"✅ Trip Verified |   We were 2 people travelling together and on the Dubai-Boston sector, the armrests on the seats allotted just wouldn’t stay up. We highlighted it to the crew before takeoff and they sent a technician to check. The technician came, saw it from a distance and went back saying he’ll send someone else. The flight took off, no one came. Highlighted to the crew again - they said, “Our technician came but you refused to get up from your seat and let him check. And we can’t help you now”.  It was a 14 hour horrendous experience and deficiency in service, coupled with a lie and blaming it on us. It was physically painful with the armrest pushing on the shoulder for 14 hours and a mental agony at such service and behaviour by the crew.",10,2024-08-11,India,True,people travelling together dubai boston sector armrest seat allotted stay highlighted crew takeoff sent technician check technician came saw distance went back saying send someone else flight took one came highlighted crew said technician came refused get seat let check help hour horrendous experience deficiency service coupled lie blaming u physically painful armrest pushing shoulder hour mental agony service behaviour crew
"Not Verified |   First time flying Emirates, was expecting a lot because this airline has a good name. Unfortunately the facts are different. Attendants on 3 of the 4 legs a have flown with them look as they are very tired. Making eye contact, heads are turned away, being in the aisle for a short moment, I was literally pushed aside by a staff member walking up and down the aisle. Meal time was too short, 1 time I got my breakfast 30 minutes before landing, 5 minutes later they tried to collect my meal again. The meals itself were overall good and the food was enjoyable. Ground services in Amsterdam and Dubai were accurate and friendly. Overall I booked my next vacation in December and avoided this airline. The feeling I got from Emirates was that I am not welcome and passengers are a burden.",4,2024-07-29,Netherlands,False,verified first time flying emirate expecting lot airline good name unfortunately fact different attendant leg flown look tired making eye contact head turned away aisle short moment literally pushed aside staff member walking aisle meal time short time got breakfast minute landing minute later tried collect meal meal overall good food enjoyable ground service amsterdam dubai accurate friendly overall booked next vacation december avoided airline feeling got emirate welcome passenger burden
"✅ Trip Verified |  Ground Staff and Service Failures on Flight EK 354. My carefully planned return trip from UK, with EMIRATES turned into a nightmare due to issues caused by their Dubai ground staff.  Upon checking in Manchester, I was issued a boarding pass for the MAN-DXB and DXB-SIN legs of my journey, with seats allocated according to my pre booking. However, upon reaching Dubai and during check-in, the counter staff took my boarding pass and issued a new one. Initially, I presumed new boarding pass was due to a soiled document and did not notice the seat change as there is no change in flight. To my disappointment, the new seat I was assigned turned out to be directly in front of the toilet onboard. I also sought assistance from cabin crew and online chat services before take-off, but unfortunately, no one helped me. I had specifically opted for an Economy Flex Plus ticket, solely to secure a seat reservation that would allow for a more comfortable journey. The proximity to the restroom doors, with their associated noise, significantly hindered my ability to rest or enjoy the flight services as intended. Furthermore, crew members accessing the overhead luggage bins above my seat at regular intervals further disrupted any chance of relaxation. Additionally, during the meal service, crew members did not lock the lavatory door, causing passengers to enter and exit while I was eating. This forced me to stop my meal. At the end of the journey, the crew sarcastically asked me about my flight experience, despite being well aware of the difficulties I had faced. Emirates' service in 2024 should be considered among the worst. Until today I have not received any reply on my compliant placed with Emirates and their customer service reminded me that it requires 60 days to send a reply. I must tell that compare to past, Emirates service quality are highly deteriorated and no one care of it there.",5,2024-07-18,Singapore,True,ground staff service failure flight ek carefully planned return trip uk emirate turned nightmare due issue caused dubai ground staff upon checking manchester issued boarding pas man dxb dxb sin leg journey seat allocated according pre booking however upon reaching dubai check counter staff took boarding pas issued new one initially presumed new boarding pas due soiled document notice seat change change flight disappointment new seat assigned turned directly front toilet onboard also sought assistance cabin crew online chat service take unfortunately one helped specifically opted economy flex plus ticket solely secure seat reservation would allow comfortable journey proximity restroom door associated noise significantly hindered ability rest enjoy flight service intended furthermore crew member accessing overhead luggage bin seat regular interval disrupted chance relaxation additionally meal service crew member lock lavatory door causing passenger enter exit eating forced stop meal end journey crew sarcastically asked flight experience despite well aware difficulty faced emirate service considered among worst today received reply compliant placed emirate customer service reminded requires day send reply must tell compare past emirate service quality highly deteriorated one care

Not Verified |   I had a flight in April from Mumbai to Dubai to London. Due to the rains / flood in Dubai flights were getting canceled but Emirates never bothered to inform the passengers. I had to spend 6k (back and forth) on Uber coming from Pune to Mumbai to catch the flight. After I got to the gate they told me the flight was canceled. I was so furious. I asked them why I never got any text or email update and they blamed it on the passengers. So I asked her to verify my phone number. When I got to the airport I checked on the app about the flight details and till that time it showed on time. They never even bothered to change that. Now that I am asking for my refund they are not taking responsibility and returning my money.,10,2024-07-12,India,False,verified flight april mumbai dubai london due rain flood dubai flight getting canceled emirate never bothered inform passenger spend k back forth uber coming pune mumbai catch flight got gate told flight canceled furious asked never got text email update blamed passenger asked verify phone number got airport checked app flight detail till time showed time never even bothered change asking refund taking responsibility returning money
"✅ Trip Verified |  It was my first time flying premium economy on Emirates, and I'd happily do it again. The seats were wide, with plenty of legroom, and the food was quite good. Service was also fine. Shame they serve Prosecco and there is very limited choice on wines, but let's skip right past that.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I have always been flying in Emirates because of their good services but this time we had a very bad experience! The cabin crews were terrible to say the least especially from Dhaka to Dubai. We asked for a Bassinet for the baby a few times but didn't get one. The baby fell asleep and I was holding for about half an hour watering a bassinet still did not get one then I had to speak to one of the cabin crews with a firm tone to get one! They didn't even offer lunch to one of my daughters. When asked, the lady said oh do you want lunch? What do you mean? She is 11 years old and needs food to eat on board, doesn't she? They also didn't give us any baby food either. My boy was hungry and crying. The lady next to me with infants had to share one of her babies food with my boy. When I fed that food to my son, one cabin crew came with some baby food which we didn't ask for saying we ran out of what you asked for. Just terrible! We also noticed in general the cabin crews were unprofessional, careless and ignoring the passengers' requests. It was a terrible experience this time.

"Not Verified |   I am writing this review to express my profound disappointment and frustration with the service provided by various departments, particularly customer support, following the cancellation of my flight from Vienna to Male last April due to the recent floods in Dubai. While I understand the circumstances surrounding the flight cancellation, the issue lies with the abysmal customer support I have encountered since then. Upon requesting a certificate for insurance purposes, I was informed that I would need to wait 30 days for processing, which I accepted as part of the procedures. However, upon receiving the certificate after the specified period, it was found to be incorrect for both myself and my travel companion. Subsequent attempts to rectify this error have been met with further delays and inefficiencies. Despite being advised to fill out another form for follow-up, it has now been two months since my initial request, and I am still awaiting the correct certificates. The lack of assistance and communication from customer support has been appalling, with promises to escalate the issue to the relevant department unfulfilled and no resolution in sight. As a loyal customer of Emirates, I am deeply dismayed by the subpar level of customer support and service provided in this instance. The unresolved issue with the certificates has also led to a delay in processing my insurance claim, further exacerbating the situation. It is truly disheartening to experience such incompetence and negligence. The disparity between the exceptional flight services and the inadequate customer support is not only disappointing but also unacceptable.",3,2024-06-27,Cyprus,False,verified writing review express profound disappointment frustration service provided various department particularly customer support following cancellation flight vienna male last april due recent flood dubai understand circumstance surrounding flight cancellation issue lie abysmal customer support encountered since upon requesting certificate insurance purpose informed would need wait day processing accepted part procedure however upon receiving certificate specified period found incorrect travel companion subsequent attempt rectify error met delay inefficiency despite advised fill another form follow two month since initial request still awaiting correct certificate lack assistance communication customer support appalling promise escalate issue relevant department unfulfilled resolution sight loyal customer emirate deeply dismayed subpar level customer support service provided instance unresolved issue certificate also led delay processing insurance claim exacerbating situation truly disheartening experience incompetence negligence disparity exceptional flight service inadequate customer support disappointing also unacceptable
"Not Verified | Having flown almost exclusely in business class for work travel paid for by my employer, the thought of 19+ hours in economy class from Delhi to Washington via Dubai filled me with dread. I was pleasantly surprised, however, by EK's economy product. While it is still economy and you can never 'go flat', I found Emirates' economy to be way better than United or Air Canada economy and, overall, offers solid hard and soft products. The seat is a decent size and has good legroom, again, compared to North American carriers. Catering was good with two full meals and a pizza or sandwich snack in between. Meal portions were good with plenty of variety. I was impressed by the 'engineering' of the economy meal tray with every conceivable space used to offer something. Every time I rang the call button, it was answered pleasantly. Washrooms were kept quite clean throughout both sectors. The ICE entertainment system offers tons of options. If paying out of my own pocket, I'd again chose EK economy.",1,2024-06-20,United States,False,verified flown almost exclusely business class work travel paid employer thought hour economy class delhi washington via dubai filled dread pleasantly surprised however ek economy product still economy never go flat found emirate economy way better united air canada economy overall offer solid hard soft product seat decent size good legroom compared north american carrier catering good two full meal pizza sandwich snack meal portion good plenty variety impressed engineering economy meal tray every conceivable space used offer something every time rang call button answered pleasantly washroom kept quite clean throughout sector ice entertainment system offer ton option paying pocket chose ek economy

"✅ Trip Verified |  Emirates provides an option to purchase extra kilograms of luggage before the flight. However, the link they provide does not lead to any option that allows for pre-purchasing luggage. Instead, the link leads to options for seat or class upgrades, food selection, or flight charges. In other words, Emirates takes extra effort to hide the option to buy extra kilograms prior to check-in. Today, I faced an extra charge of £380 because I was not given the option to purchase extra kilograms in advance. I tried searching but could not find the actual link to buy extra luggage.

"✅ Trip Verified |  The economy cabin in this airline is the worst in the world. Very rude flight attendants and crew. They only take care of higher levels, and other passengers, who are the majority of people in flight, are nothing to them. I was the gold member of this airline, and I stopped to fly with them. After 14 years, I tried to gain with minor hope for some changes, but it was worse than before. The crew's attitude on the ground and flights with economic passengers is unbelievable. It seems all of them are trained to deal with economy passengers like this.

"✅ Trip Verified |  No service with customer service has been terrible. They simply do not care about passengers. My sister had to cancel her leg of trip due to a diagnosed blood disorder that was serious enough she could not travel far from her home, fly, sit for long periods etc. While she undergoes series of tests to figure out cause and how to help her, Emirates would not let her cancel her one way, outbound flight. The flight does not leave for 7 months. They feel she can rest up and be healed by the date of departure.  She does have a flexible economy ticket to make the cancellation. They claim medical reasons are not approved reasons for cancellation of most of ticket value. Trying to change the name so i can save the trip and take a friend instead? Nope!

"Not Verified | My first experience travelling First Class (using Qantas points) was pretty surreal. Having flown the best (and worst) of discount airlines and everything in between, this was something else. Just the sense that you're the only one on board and that you call the shots. It was other-worldly. I drank dom perignon for 7 hours, ate a lot of caviar and chatted to some lovely relaxed staff (after all, they only had four passengers to attend to). The 'suite' was large, comfortable and opulent. Of course it was... Even though it was a 777 (not a 380), there was an absolute sense of luxury. Not sure if I'll ever try/fly first class again, but it was worth the points and a lot of fun.",1,2024-05-28,Australia,False,verified first experience travelling first class using qantas point pretty surreal flown best worst discount airline everything something else sense one board call shot worldly drank dom perignon hour ate lot caviar chatted lovely relaxed staff four passenger attend suite large comfortable opulent course even though absolute sense luxury sure ever try fly first class worth point lot fun
"✅ Trip Verified |  Decent flights, but unremarkable. Service was polite but disengaged, with little attempt by crew to interact with passengers. Seats were comfortable, with good legroom. I thought the IFE was excellent, with some quality new releases to choose from. The meals were large and generous - I am a Qatar Airways frequent flyer, and the Emirates meals are significantly larger than those on Qatar. However, the alcohol options are far smaller on Emirates, and on both flights I was only offered a drink once per flight.

"✅ Trip Verified | I fly a lot, but Emirates were my worst experiences ever. Most importantly, 2 out of 2 times I flew with them, I was delayed for multiple hours. The first time it was just sitting on the plane with no AC for 2 hours, and the second was 3+ hours, due to some trivial problem with their cabin lights. That 2nd time I had a connecting flight to catch, and while on board they assured me it would be fine, and while I did make it to the gate while they were still boarding, they refused to board me due to having apparently unilaterally decided to rebook me to a flight 11 hours later, assuming I wouldn't make it. Turns out there were earlier flights, but they wouldn't book me to them due to not codesharing with those airlines. Not only was no compensation offered for this day-long delay, but when I finally booked a separate flight on my own, they wouldn't even refund me, and had me request it on my own online. Overall they just showed 0 willingness to help throughout the entire process, despite it being 100% their fault, for a delay caused by them and between flights both of which they operated. They made it as painful as it possibly could be, every step of the way. Oh, and the flights themselves were also bad - old-looking airplanes, terrible food, and relatively limited entertainment. Emirates might have earned a positive reputation due to their First Class experience, but for Economy flights, it's probably the worst airline I've ever flown.",10,2024-05-26,Israel,True,fly lot emirate worst experience ever importantly time flew delayed multiple hour first time sitting plane ac hour second hour due trivial problem cabin light nd time connecting flight catch board assured would fine make gate still boarding refused board due apparently unilaterally decided rebook flight hour later assuming make turn earlier flight book due codesharing airline compensation offered day long delay finally booked separate flight even refund request online overall showed willingness help throughout entire process despite fault delay caused flight operated made painful possibly could every step way oh flight also bad old looking airplane terrible food relatively limited entertainment emirate might earned positive reputation due first class experience economy flight probably worst airline ever flown

Not only that, the flight attendant didn’t apologise on both occasions which are of different time stamps, that’s a poor representative of the airline and i believe this is rather basic. Moreover and unfortunately, screen on the seat was blank and was requesting assistance to resolve it. Was reassured that it will be troubleshoot in 10-15 minutes. Guess what? Wasn’t resolve throughout the remaining of the flight. And also, i believe it’s basic to walk down the aisle once in awhile at your respective section to check-in with the guests to see everything is alright and needs immediate attention, but am noticing a pattern on both occasions, to and fro Dubai and Singapore.

"Not Verified |   On both the outward and return flights, I or my travel partner sat on a broken seat. Yes, we had booked economically, but then you can expect a fully functioning chair, right? Our flight to Bali took more than twenty hours in total. The quality of the chairs was nothing to write home about. We arrived at all destinations broken. I bought a new suitcase in Bali. This one also arrived “broken” at home in Amsterdam. One flight with Emirates was apparently too much for this beautiful suitcase. After some correspondence back and forth with Emirates, the conclusion was that they could not do anything for me and would not take responsibility. My conclusion is therefore to take a look at other companies where service may still be expected. In any case, I won't be booking Emirates again anytime soon. My next flight to Bali is with our KLM. Zowel op de heen- als op de terugvlucht zat ik of mijn reispartner op een kapotte stoel. Ja, we hadden economisch geboekt, maar dan mag je toch wel een volledig functionerende stoel verwachten?

"✅ Trip Verified |  The service provided is absolutely unacceptable and beyond what I’ve ever experienced. The flight from Lisbon to Dubai was delayed by 3 hrs. Connecting flight to Phuket was missed due to that which of course can happen but there was zero handling of the situation in Dubai - it took 4,5 hours at the airport standing in lines to get a new boarding pass and a hotel voucher. Before that no information at all. After all this they take you to a hotel which is 30 minutes away from the airport without telling before which hotel and where it is - arriving at the hotel another long waiting session and then no one can say when the shuttle bus is going back to the airport - we don’t have that information, end of conversation! Zero information. Zero service. I booked seats on the flight in advance to be able to rest and in the email about the new flight it said the booked seat will remain for the new flight but that is not the case at all. So now instead of my paid window seat I’m sitting straight in the middle. All the service chat tells you is to file a complaint. Also I paid for a hotel in Phuket that I don’t get to use. This was by far the worst I’ve ever experienced by any airline. It’s such a joke, the way they treat people, their customers.

"✅ Trip Verified | Every step of the travel, I found harassment, terrible customer support, and absolutely no help. I am treated like an economy class customer in all aspects. Check-in: 1. Rude arrogant check in staff at SFO: refused to accommodate a box that exceeded 59 inches though far underweight than half of 70 kgs allowed. Arrogant staff refused to ever entertain my request as the app clearly mentioned that I could take up to 115 inches, without mentioning additional cost over 59 inches. 2. Reached DXB. At the gate, someone came over with my name and he was not aware of hotel option despite mentioning that I received it in my last trip. When I finally approach Terminal 3 First class lounge, they gave me hotel voucher after a lot of time. Even lounge front desk didn't have that information. 3. The lounge front desk refused to help me get to chauffeur service, didn't tell me 'EXACT' steps on how to reach Arrivals. It was the most terrible experience for someone going there for the first time. The desk that manages Chauffer service was incompetent and provided inaccurate gate info where I could get car to hotel. All this exercise took 1.5 hours, eating up on my plans to go out to the city. 4. When I checked back in the following day, 27th Feb, the second bag was not loaded despite being first class, despite paying for it and despite 19 hours of transit. When I landed and waited for it at carousel, app displayed delayed bag with PIR info. 5. Apparently the customer service agents pretended that they cannot get my contact details to update the baggage claim report/PIR and kept blaming me for it. They knew the flight I was in, the bag number and access to my profile, but kept saying that they can't update me because I didn't provide phone number and email address, both were there in my Emirates profile long before my travel date. 6. No communication on missed bag despite repeated contacts with customer support.

"✅ Trip Verified |  First time i have lost my baggage after arrival and the help was next to nothing. 1 out of my 2 baggage was missing after we have arrived in Singapore airport. After waiting at the belt and asking a member of staff at the airport then we have found out that this baggage tag was no scanned at my transfer in Dubai. therefore the baggage was somewhere in Dubai not knowing if it has been identified or lost yet. The airport team gave me a Reference and told me that they will keep me updated. i asked for a number to call to the airport office and they provided a number on the form. Next day called the number it was a switch board and after multiple attempts and speaking to the agent you cannot transfer to the airport counter and they do not know anything They tell you that someone will be in touch but that is not true. The customer service helpline on Emirates website is useless as you cannot get through or speak to a real person for help. I had no idea the next couple of days where my luggage was or if it is lost? No communication what so ever throughout, multiple emails/ calls/ feedback to emirates but no response.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My Emirates experience was horrific, starting at Delhi airport where ground staff threatened to deny boarding unless I forced my laptop into my carry-on.  Boarding pass retrieval led to another confrontation at the gate. Emirates staff at the gate confiscated my boarding passes, threatened baggage offloading, and harassed me for carrying my laptop bag separately. Only after pledging to stow my laptop bag under my seat was I allowed to board just before departure. Upon reaching LA, I discovered a missing bag. It took days for Emirates to locate it. Emirates staff, without notice or gate codes, knocked at midnight, delivering my damaged bag. How they accessed it remains a mystery.

"✅ Trip Verified | This was my first trip on Emirates. I paid $1,400 for my economy ticket. I also paid to select my seats. I specifically chose an aisle seat because I have neuropathy and needed to ensure I could stand up regularly to avoid blood clots & not disturb others. Immediately, I noticed the man sitting next to me, sharing an armrest with me, that he dominated, was sniffing and digging hard up his nose every couple of minutes nonstop. He would then touch everything around us, including the armrest. Each time he dug up his nose, he would grab the armrest that we shared in common. He also put his hand on my side and touched the screen, picked up something that fell and handed it to me. He was openly digging up his nose and touching everything while sniffing, indicating sickness. I was wearing a mask. He was not. I was entirely grossed out and very concerned for my health and safety. It was not a one time act, but a continuing behavior, every few minutes. I told attendants to observe his conduct too. The flight was over 12 hours long and I could not stomach this nasty behavior the long flight and risk my fragile health and safety sitting next to this man, imagine trying to eat next to him. I spoke to the flight attendants a minimum of three different times. Their eventual solution was to move me from my seat up front to the very back of the airplane, far from my colleagues. I was traveling with three companions, two sitting in front of me and one in first class. Our paid seats were the first seats behind economy preferred class. There were dozens of available seats in that section that were close to my companions and only a few feet away from the section I was sitting in that I paid for. Rather than make my health a priority and move me to a safer section, they attempted to move me to the very back of the plane. They said they couldn't say anything to the man. I didn't want to leave my companions. It was so frequent that I took evidence the entire flight to prove it. The only time he used a napkin was when they served food, and he used the one from his tray to clean his nose. That is the napkin he dropped on me, reaching over me to the stewardess. It was their jobs to help keep me safe. I was content in the seat I purchased near the front, on the aisle. I wasn't seeking to be upgraded. But if those were the only seats available, in close proximity to the seat I purchased, and still near my companions; rather than make me sit over 12 hours stressed out trying to avoid bodily fluids; put at a health & safety risk sitting next to a man openly wiping his bodily fluids on my seat, the armrest & me, they should have moved me to those seats, not the back of the plane.",1,2024-01-25,United States,True,first trip emirate paid economy ticket also paid select seat specifically chose aisle seat neuropathy needed ensure could stand regularly avoid blood clot disturb others immediately noticed man sitting next sharing armrest dominated sniffing digging hard nose every couple minute nonstop would touch everything around u including armrest time dug nose would grab armrest shared common also put hand side touched screen picked something fell handed openly digging nose touching everything sniffing indicating sickness wearing mask entirely grossed concerned health safety one time act continuing behavior every minute told attendant observe conduct flight hour long could stomach nasty behavior long flight risk fragile health safety sitting next man imagine trying eat next spoke flight attendant minimum three different time eventual solution move seat front back airplane far colleague traveling three companion two sitting front one first class paid seat first seat behind economy preferred class dozen available seat section close companion foot away section sitting paid rather make health priority move safer section attempted move back plane said say anything man want leave companion frequent took evidence entire flight prove time used napkin served food used one tray clean nose napkin dropped reaching stewardess job help keep safe content seat purchased near front aisle seeking upgraded seat available close proximity seat purchased still near companion rather make sit hour stressed trying avoid bodily fluid put health safety risk sitting next man openly wiping bodily fluid seat armrest moved seat back plane
"✅ Trip Verified | Check in desk at Montreal airport going to Philippines: We were traveling as a family with my senior mom, my wife and my infant that was 11months old. We did our check in online and made sure we chose a bulkhead seat to be able to use the basinet. To our surprise when we got to the plane they have changed our seats without letting us know. Very inconvenient and stressful since we where counting on those seats. The explanation they gave to us was that when there is a change of the type of plane they can not guarantee the seats we chose. I believe thats not a good reason to give and is a sorry excuse. If there is a change of any sort they have the responsibility to let us know I would have been glad to pay for a better seat. Morever, our return flight was even worst. At the checkein gate right before boarding,from Dubai to Montreal, they told us that we needed to check-in our carryon bags since there was no space on the overhead storage due to full capacity. We told them that we can not do so since we have an infant with us and that the carry on and baby diaper bags where a must, plus her toys,formula and food etc. They still refuse and told us we needed to check in our carry on. We were within what we were allowed to bring to the plane and still we needed to check in our things. I find this ridiculous. They do not meet the product that they are offering or selling and they have no sence of transparency at this point and a sense of understanding the situation we were in. The staff also was rude and just ignored my concerns. Not a family friendly airline thats for sure. Food and entertainment: horrible and tastless and the 2 planes going back from philippines to Dubai and transit then to Montreal my entertainement screen were broken.

"Not Verified |   My wife and I along with 2 friends took the Emirates flight from Newark, NJ to Athens in September 2023. We had never flown on Emirates but decided to give them a try over American or Delta. The numerous tv commercials with actress Penelope Cruz has subliminally triggered something that inspired me to convince my wife and friends that we should give them a try. At the time of our ""economy"" booking we decided to pay an additional $410 per couple for seat upgrades. We had opted to pay more for the 2 seats together rather than the sitting in a row of three or fours seat in the center of the plane. As soon as we boarded the plane and took our seats I knew the outbound flight was going to be torture. The 2 seats that we paid $205 extra for were so small with walled sides and hand rests that didn't move would have been great if we were all contortionists but unfortunately we were not. We made it to Athens 10 hours later and after a couple of good nights sleep we put this horrible memory behind us so as not to ruin our 2 week long awaited vacation. About a week into the trip we did some research on the web and decided to downgrade our return seats from the same mini seats that we flew out on and instead opted for the standard seats that were in the middle section of the plane that included 4 seats. This was a great move as our return flight was much more comfortable. When I contacted Emirates upon our arrival and asked to get back the $205 paid for the return downgraded seats, their reply was that they do not issue refunds for seat downgrades. That said, the 4 of us will never travel on Emirates again. As a postscript I want to mention that none of the 4 our us, all retired and in our late 60's are heavy or have large behinds, to the contrary, we are all smaller individuals who have never had any comparable torturous seats while flying anywhere in the world.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I (via a travel agent) booked a round-trip business class flight with Emirates that ended in Queenstown, NZ. Upon arriving for a layover in Melbourne at 23:30 after a 13-hour business class flight from Dubai, I was looking forward to a shower. However, I was denied entry to the Emirates lounge, without any real explanation as to why. The gentleman at the counter was more interested in making me go away than helping me understand the situation, so, confused, I called Emirates ""customer service."" They bluntly informed me that if I wanted to use the lounge so badly, my travel agent should have booked the flight from Melbourne to Queenstown on Qantas. As it turns out, the leg from Melbourne to Queenstown that I had was on Emirates partner Jetstar. As Jetstar does not have a business class cabin, this one leg (out of 5 total legs) was economy. I should note that the entire itinerary was booked through Emirates, and part of my confusion stemmed from the fact that they all had Emirates flight numbers. But what I had here was an Emirates flight operated by Jetstar (and the same flight also had a Qantas flight number - one flight, three partners, three numbers). I should have gotten the Emirates flight operated by Qantas that was departing an hour later, as Qantas has a business class cabin, and it would have been the same cost anyway. If it's the same cost anyway, why not let me come in and take a shower? It's 1am and there is no one else here. Additionally, they do not care if the arriving flight is business, or if 4/5 legs are business, you are not special.

The crew were inattentive and disinterested, just bringing up a course and then disappearing until they brought the next. It was Economy service with only slightly better food.

"✅ Trip Verified |   It was my first experience with Emirates which was quite unpleasant by handling from the cabin crews. The screen was broken then they changed you from row 18 to row 45. However, they won’t change to one row before which 17 because all they care is selling the seats instead of passenger’s convenience. Also during 50 mins of turbulence they only allow business class passengers use the toilet and the whole economic class passengers were not allowed. Only BC PAXs have the skill to protect themself during turbulence and EC PAXs can’t do it? I wrote a complaints and they responded that I have accepted the alternative seat but actually I went to original seat which the screen was broken (including call button).

"✅ Trip Verified |   First I was separated from my wife of 35 years and then despite my plea of a stiff shoulder I was given a window seat in all my 42 years of flying. Emirates seem to treat its tour group passengers as 2nd class passengers without any rights. My wife and I flew to Spain and Portugal from Singapore on a packaged tour with a travel group. On our return flights first from Madrid to Dubai on EK142 on 9 Oct 2023 and from Dubai to Singapore on EK 354 on 10 Oct 2023, my wife and I were placed on window seats on the opposite sides of the aircraft. When I enquired at the check in counter for an aisle seat for the 2 flights as I am a tall bloke with a stiff shoulder (which has been affecting me for the past 5 years), the staff gave me an aisle seat further back and my wife in a window seat 6 rows ahead. She said she tried but could not see the connecting flight seating plan from Dubai to Singapore and advised me to approach the boarding gate in Dubai for help. When we reached Dubai, the tour manager, my wife and I, another another couple who had been in opposite ends of the aircraft made a beeline for the connecting help desk close to B18 boarding gate. The guard refused to let us into the queue even though there was no one queuing and the 2 counter staff were helping a couple of the passengers at the counter. He told us to use the self-help kiosk computer even though we said we needed help with changing the seats. The computer did not do the latter and directed back to the counter. The guard was still reluctant and finally allowed my wife and I in the queue. However, our tour manager and the couple were kept outside the line even though they had legitimate business to speak to someone at the counter. There was a couple talking to a group of the staff outside the counter near the queue and the man was gesticulating wildly in a heated discussion with the staff. Eventually one of the staff involved in the 'conversation' told the guard to admit all of us and 'royally allowed' us to talk to him behind the counter. He told us in no uncertain terms that we were given our seats as 'non-paying' passengers and it was tough luck that we had to be separated. Our tour manager protested that the tour passenger list with familial/partnering connections was given to the airline beforehand but he said we were given a block of seats from rows 81 to 83 and he could not help in any way. My question to the airline is this: if the passenger list has been provided with the different familial/partnering groupings could it not be more accommodating and doing a slipshod job of seating willy nilly without regard for the families and couples travelling together. What happens if there are families with young children? Furthermore if the airline has given a block of seats (say rows 61 to 63 or 81 to 83 and not all window seats or not all middle seats) in advance why can't it have the good sense to pass them on the tour manager beforehand so the tour manager can help to allocate the seats according to the passengers' preference and needs?

"✅ Trip Verified |   I wish to express my dissatisfaction with my recent experience on Emirates Flight EK2185, scheduled for August 6th, 2023, from Dubai to Catania. The flight was canceled less than 24 hours in advance, which severely impacted my long-haul trip. This trip was booked through the Emirates website and was disrupted just hours before its departure due to the cited 'unforeseen circumstances,' namely a fire at Catania Airport, which had occurred three weeks prior. Being an aware passenger, I was cognizant of the previous flight cancellations to Catania and the airport's incapacity to handle extra-Schengen flights. Consequently, I had been diligently monitoring the situation, investing significant time and financial resources from a remote location in South Africa to stay updated and explore alternative travel options in case of an eventual cancellation. My distressing experience began when I found myself caught in a bureaucratic game of ping-pong between Emirates and Flydubai, the airline operating the flight. Both carriers appeared to evade responsibility and failed to offer me any practical alternative plans. The cancellation notification reached me while I was en route to the airport, necessitating an unscheduled stop in an area with phone reception to contact the Emirates call center, as per Flydubai's app recommendation. To my dismay, I spent over 30 minutes on the phone only to discover that Emirates was not presenting any viable options for reaching my final destination. Furthermore, their communication regarding alternative flights from Dubai to Italy was initially unclear—mentioning Rome or Milan—and later, limited to Naples, with no apparent connection to Catania. It was only after a protracted discussion that the call-center operator finally intervened, reconfiguring my entire reservation to a flight bound for Milan, just an hour before my scheduled check-in at Skukuza. This change, which was seemingly necessitated by Emirates' arcane policies, left me in Dubai without compensation for the additional time spent there. I was accommodated in a shared room with no meals, a circumstance that I managed to secure solely because my partner already had a reservation for a Dubai Connect service. Following the call-center operator's instructions, I had to personally book a new flight from Milan to Catania, incurring additional expenses. The overwhelming stress and uncertainty surrounding this ordeal marred a significant portion of my holiday experience. I requested that Emirates recognized the hardships I endured during this journey, including the extra costs incurred due to the days of delay and the missed medical appointment. However, they just said they could do nothing.",2,2023-10-08,Italy,True,wish express dissatisfaction recent experience emirate flight ek scheduled august th dubai catania flight canceled le hour advance severely impacted long haul trip trip booked emirate website disrupted hour departure due cited unforeseen circumstance namely fire catania airport occurred three week prior aware passenger cognizant previous flight cancellation catania airport incapacity handle extra schengen flight consequently diligently monitoring situation investing significant time financial resource remote location south africa stay updated explore alternative travel option case eventual cancellation distressing experience began found caught bureaucratic game ping pong emirate flydubai airline operating flight carrier appeared evade responsibility failed offer practical alternative plan cancellation notification reached en route airport necessitating unscheduled stop area phone reception contact emirate call center per flydubai app recommendation dismay spent minute phone discover emirate presenting viable option reaching final destination furthermore communication regarding alternative flight dubai italy initially unclear mentioning rome milan later limited naples apparent connection catania protracted discussion call center operator finally intervened reconfiguring entire reservation flight bound milan hour scheduled check skukuza change seemingly necessitated emirate arcane policy left dubai without compensation additional time spent accommodated shared room meal circumstance managed secure solely partner already reservation dubai connect service following call center operator instruction personally book new flight milan catania incurring additional expense overwhelming stress uncertainty surrounding ordeal marred significant portion holiday experience requested emirate recognized hardship endured journey including extra cost incurred due day delay missed medical appointment however said could nothing

"✅ Trip Verified | I had a poor experience on this flight. I have been using Emirates' services for over 20 years, being a Blue member and, then, a Silver member, up until the time of covid. I have had no reason to complain, previously about Emirates’ service. Sitting in seat 30F, I had ordered vegetarian food, and received a snack soon after take-off, along with a sealed cup of water. Subsequently, meals for other passengers were brought round and people were offered drinks, but I was offered nothing, and the steward moved on too quickly for me to request a drink. At the next opportunity, when a steward passed by, I requested a drink, but was advised to wait until lunch was served (a very poor response, I felt). I reiterated: I would like a drink as soon as possible (as I was thirsty). The person in seat 30G was asleep and I could not exit the seat with causing a disturbance. A drink was subsequently provided (but over 15 minutes later). However, the table in 30F is/was not secure and the drink slid off, spilled over me and the person in 30G next to me. The people sitting either side of me were more helpful than the steward in trying to clear up the mess. Later on, lunch did arrive, but it was 2 hours after I had first requested a drink (so, my request for a drink had been vindicated). When food trays were later collected, mine was overlooked, the steward passed me by, and my food tray was left for over half an hour. When a steward passed by, I asked that the tray be removed and could not understand why I was being treated in what seemed a negligent manner. At this point, I was beginning to become very fed up. A supervisor later came round and asked if I was alright. I was fine (albeit tired), but frustrated at having been ignored and overlooked. The supervisor was firm, but unapologetic, and asked me if I needed anything. I did not need anything, and she left me without further comment, her enquiry appearing pointless to me, as it solved nothing. Following this experience, I am unlikely to use Emirates again, which has left me thoroughly disillusioned with the company.",6,2023-09-22,United Kingdom,True,poor experience flight using emirate service year blue member silver member time covid reason complain previously emirate service sitting seat f ordered vegetarian food received snack soon take along sealed cup water subsequently meal passenger brought round people offered drink offered nothing steward moved quickly request drink next opportunity steward passed requested drink advised wait lunch served poor response felt reiterated would like drink soon possible thirsty person seat g asleep could exit seat causing disturbance drink subsequently provided minute later however table f secure drink slid spilled person g next people sitting either side helpful steward trying clear mess later lunch arrive hour first requested drink request drink vindicated food tray later collected mine overlooked steward passed food tray left half hour steward passed asked tray removed could understand treated seemed negligent manner point beginning become fed supervisor later came round asked alright fine albeit tired frustrated ignored overlooked supervisor firm unapologetic asked needed anything need anything left without comment enquiry appearing pointless solved nothing following experience unlikely use emirate left thoroughly disillusioned company

"✅ Trip Verified |  The return journey from HKG to BKK reaffirmed the low quality of the airline that I experienced on the outward journey. Added to that however, was the 50 minutes to queue in the Online Check-in, having arrived at the airport more than the recommended 3 hours before flight departure. This is presumably as a result of only 2 check-in counters open for Online check-in. 2 were available for those who had not checked in, and these seemed to move more quickly. Once through, and with enough time to grab a bite at the airport, the greeting on board was initially friendly, but then the surly attitude of any staff with whom I came into any brief contact, (one, who removed my light hand luggage with laptop, to accommodate a passenger at the Emergency Exit, who's steamer trunk ""hand luggage"" could not fit into the overhead luggage bin above his seat, (which Emirates call ""hat rack""; if only).

"✅ Trip Verified |  The issues I encountered include a significant problem with their cancellation policy, lack of responsiveness from their customer service team, concerning safety practices, refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage, an extensive delay during the return flight, and a stark contrast in service quality between Economy and Business class. Regarding the cancellation policy, I received misleading information from three representatives, who assured me that I would receive a full refund if I canceled within 24 hours. However, they failed to mention the crucial condition that this only applied when the flight was at least 7 days after the initial booking. As a result, I tried to cancel within the 24-hour window but could only reschedule. This cost me a $500 loss vs. the option of cancelling and booking a new flight for the following day. Despite Emirates acknowledging in writing their mistake, they repeatedly refused to provide a price match or refund, and eventually even stopped replying to my follow up messages on the open complain. The lack of responsiveness from Emirates compounded my frustration. Numerous follow-up messages went unanswered, showing a lack of interest in resolving the issues I faced.  During the flight, I was alarmed by a safety practice where all blankets were collected and piled in front of the emergency exits.  Emirates also declined to reimburse me for one of two damaged pieces of luggage, despite the damage occurring during their handling.  Furthermore, the return flight experienced a significant delay for a missing document, resulting in passengers being seated on the plane for over two hours, including boarding time. Despite the delay being just a few minutes short of two hours, the lack of updates, assistance, and provisions such as free Wi-Fi or refreshments left passengers feeling inconvenienced and neglected.

"✅ Trip Verified |  The on-board internet simply does not work. If you complain, the supplier for Emirates, 'Sita for Aircraft' simply refuse to acknowledge that they failed to provide a service and issue a refund. It appears from multiple reviews that this happens often. Emirates themselves, apart from the non-existent internet and poor third party after-sales experience were pretty good, ample leg room, friendly staff, good selection of movies but poor food choice - fish or vegetables only. The check-in was also poor. I followed the check in signs for economy seats at Dubai airport T3, waited for around 20-30 mins before being told to check in at desk 5 (flights to USA) - i wasn't flying to the USA, how am i supposed to know to follow that sign?

"✅ Trip Verified |  I'm writing this review so others won't go through what went through. This airline has no accountability whatsoever. The day of my flight I was denied check in. The reason was that I had less than 6 month validity on my passport which was not required for my destination. The Emirates agent at the check-in booth told me he wouldn't let me on the flight and then offered my seat to a standby client. Because of this I missed my flight, I had to renew my passeport in less than 24h and lost 2 days stay at the hotel. I had to pay 300$+ ticket as penalty to board on the next flight not to mention the psychological distress I was put under (I have depression/anxiety disorder). I was travelling with a group and someone in my group has checked in with no problem with passport validity less than 6 months. When I contacted Emirates for refund they said the agent didn't declare the incident and put me as no show on the system although I was there in time with the group. I was told by Emirates that without the name of the agent they can do nothing about it. In short Emirates agents can freely deny you your flight manipulate the system and sell your seat to another person and you can do nothing about it.",7,2023-07-04,Tunisia,True,writing review others go went airline accountability whatsoever day flight denied check reason le month validity passport required destination emirate agent check booth told let flight offered seat standby client missed flight renew passeport le h lost day stay hotel pay ticket penalty board next flight mention psychological distress put depression anxiety disorder travelling group someone group checked problem passport validity le month contacted emirate refund said agent declare incident put show system although time group told emirate without name agent nothing short emirate agent freely deny flight manipulate system sell seat another person nothing
"✅ Trip Verified | Very friendly check in staff, same goes for the lounge staff, however there was only one on the front desk, and was tied up selling with upgrades or lounge access which meant that we had a 10 min wait before we got access. Lounge itself was nice and had just been refurbished, how ever food selection was average with several things having run out and not replaced. Flight it’s self was good but due to midnight departure staff were just going through the motions. The beef tenderloin has to be the driest toughest piece of meat to have ever been served on an airplane. Overall I have had better experiences on other carriers.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I decided to fly Emirates again after having a very unfortunate first experience with them a few years ago. Well what I can tell now from 4 flights with them is that they are a hit or miss airline. Some crew members will be friendly and professional others on the same flight will be rude and careless. What others have mentioned on these reviews is true, they will run out of meals option easily and you will have to settle with leftovers if you are seated at the rear. I have noticed the aircrafts are becoming very overused, some had broken features and a funny smell. The food is very basic if compared to other premium airlines.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I'm motivated to write this critical review after multiple phone-hours with customer service agents with Emirates in the hope that others would benefit (and that Emirates would listen!). We had booked a return flight from/to STL-COK via YYZ and DXB. The first flight from STL to YYZ was by its code share partner Air Canada. Unfortunately, just a couple weeks before our flight, Air Canada changed the flight time such that it was not possible to catch the flight from YYZ to DXB. We reached out to Emirates, our primary booking partner, to rebook and were provided a rerouting option through ORD (Chicago) for an additional $3300 for 3 tickets. Annoyed by this suggestion, we requested to fly Air Canada flight the day before, which was turned down because of unavailability of economy class tickets. Because of lack of viable options, we decided to drop the flight from STL-YYZ but retain the flights from YYZ-DXB and DXB-COK, with the idea of booking our own flights from STL-YYZ. We booked this flight for the day before, so we also had to book overnight stay in YYZ. When we filed a travel claim which needed a certificate of flight delay, Emirates asked me to reach out to Air Canada. Unfortunately, Air Canada had none of our names in their system and it was impossible to reach their customer service for further assistance. In summary, we have spent almost $2800 (flight tickets + overnight stay) for Air Canada/Emirates' incompetence and are unable to get a 'flight delayed' certificate to process our legitimate claim. Please beware when booking flights through Emirates because it takes absolutely NO responsibility for their code share partners' mistakes. All I received were platitudes such as, 'we understand', 'that is awful', etc. over the phone but with no real help to process our claim.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service. I flew Dubai- B'Ham- Dubai in economy class. Emirates has common counters where you can check in your luggage. Initially, I was skeptical (particularly on the DXB-BHX route) but Emirates made no mistakes. This is quite convenient as you can check in quickly and go to the lounge. The flight departed on time, the crew had a smile and were quite professional. Food was sufficient in quantity and quite good with metal cutlery in economy class. There was another snack service followed by juices/hot drinks 1.5 hours before landing. The seating is quite good and has a seat [pitch of 32""). B777s in use by Emirates are getting old and you can see the signs. Their ICE system was excellent. I am not sure I would like the Business class seats here as they weren't lie-flat but I was flying economy. Families with kids were well taken care of with flight attendants distributing amenities and offering to take and share instant pictures using Polaroid cameras. The in-flight wifi was free for text messaging using WhatsApp, even in economy if you have Skywards membership. My only complaint during the trip is that the plane was parked far off and required considerable walking at Terminal 3 in Dubai to reach immigration (which was a breeze).

"✅ Trip Verified | What a disappointment. Emirates is lauded as having one of the best inflight experiences in the world. They obviously spend a lot of money marketing the experience as such.

It’s the first time I’ve flown business and had my meal served on a tray. Never addressed or welcomed by name aside from when my boarding card was presented on entering the aircraft. Crew were polite when you got their attention, but most of the time they were avoiding eye contact when racing through the cabin.

"✅ Trip Verified | Emirates is an airline that tries to maximize the amount of money that it can squeeze out of customers, whilst providing the minimum possible service.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the worst experience of my lifetime flying with Emirates. It all started from Thiruvananthapuram where our travel began, food was just pathetic and the service is just awful. Let alone the seats are not even comfortable with hardly any legroom. Sitting on the seat for less than an hour and you feel your bones crushing on the frame of the seat. The flight attendants seem like overly busy even if they were to walk past you and you ask them for a glass of water. The next leg was the long haul. Both my wife and I were just exhausted with the service and the flight attendants wouldn't even get a band aid after I cut myself from hitting my feet on the fasteners of the seat.  We waited for almost an hr after boarding from Dubai to take off and I ended up cutting myself while being seated and I showed my feet to the flight attendant, and she didn't even care to get back to me until my wife had to address it 48 minutes later.  The seats are as poor as the first leg. How do you expect customers to sit in these seats for such long-haul flights. No legroom and the people in front when they recline the seat your stuck with the tray on your diaphragm. I seriously dreaded the flight and the attendants as well. There was a lot of overhead Cabin baggage space where she could open and look but instead just chose to stand where she was and asked me if she could move my bag. Then when another passenger had to get his bag up, she asks my wife if the bag was hers and it was the bag of the passenger behind us. She was like it's my bag and leave it there and then the flight attendant got back to us and asked my wife to move her bag and I said no. Why don't you move the other bag instead. She didn't even have the courtesy to look for other bins if it wasn't full. But just stood in her vicinity to put the bag in and get the job done. I don't understand why do these kind of staff even work. Going to TRV via Dubai the men flight attendants were just so rude that they act like they are doing you a favor by getting you a glass of water.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the misfortune of booking a flight on Emirates for my daughter to fly as an unaccompanied minor. All flights were expensive so I used an app to find some cheaper flights and booked on line. I must mention that I checked with their terms and conditions to make sure I could call and change the flight to an unaccompanied minor. Firstly I never received the itinerary so I called Emirates to get this sent. Secondly I could barely understand the operator as he mumbled and had a strong accent. Once I had the itinerary I then told them I needed the unaccompanied minor added. Because I had booked flights operated by Emirates but run by Qantas, I needed to call Qantas to make the change. So I called Qantas, they had no record of the flights, then told me I need to change through the airline I booked. I called Emirates again and explained, they then said I assure you it needs to be done by Qantas. I went back and forth from airline to airline multiple times until Emirates then said there is no way I can change to unaccompanied minor and Qantas would not change it either, I finally had enough and asked to speak to someone who knew what they were doing. I spoke to a supervisor who was not rude or anything but stated I’d need to cancel the flight, take the hit and rebook via phone. I don’t think so, referring to their website that says booking electronically then adding a service is perfectly acceptable. So now I have return tickets in my daughters name that we can’t use.

"Not Verified |  I strongly recommend flying with a different airline if you have an infant. Emirates are not what they used to be and their customer care is horrific. I booked a bassinet for my baby which means booking a middle seat. I booked 3 months in advance so I had the pick of any seat, yet I checked the requirements for a bassinet and was confident I would be allowed one. Obviously for my baby to have a bassinet was more important than me having a comfortable seat so the sacrifice was made and I chose a seat with a bassinet. Upon boarding I was told my baby was too big for a bassinet. I told them she meets the height and weight requirements but they insisted she was too big. They told me if a baby is capable of reaching the bottom of the bassinet they could push out the press studs and collapse the bassinet, implying that only babies who don’t move in their sleep are able to use a bassinet. This left me in complete distress knowing I had 15 hours ahead of me with my infant on my knee on a front row middle seat. I was in a fit of tears and the flight attendant said sorry there’s nothing I can do. Our flight was at 9pm so I had already been awake all day and had no sleep the whole flight. I couldn’t eat because the fold out tray from the chair arm wouldn’t fit in front of me and my baby and the one time she was asleep my meal had two hairs in it. I was so upset I just gave them my tray back (to which they huffed at me for having to take it when they weren’t ready) and didn’t eat for the journey. I then had a 3 hour wait in Dubai before another 7 hour flight. I asked if I could change this seat and they said no the flights was full which caused me to have a panic attack and almost faint after no food or sleep for a very long time. No one attended to me except one passenger and we had to get on the plane and sit in a middle seat for another 7 hours with no sleep.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I usually don't write reviews but it was a terrible, expensive travel experience and unfortunately my return is already booked with them. There was numerous issues. Food was terrible. Menu was badly selected like there was no balance nor properly matched dishes. It didn't taste good either. Snacks were bad too. In both my flights, from London to Dubai and Dubai to Phuket I had same issues with the seat. First seats are low quality shakes wiggles a lot and offers low comfort. Only good thing was leg space. In both flights infotainment system was broken. Cabin crew tried numerous resets which took 30mins each. On the 4th reset both times it worked but then suddenly while watching it stopped working again. They didn't even offer another seat and there was available options. This is crazy! Absolutely worse service and customer support ever. They have no vegetarian option. They only had Indian vegetarian option which is completely different and tailored for Indian cuisine. I would expect them to just change the main dish on the regular meal right but no! They brought vegetarian meal long before everyone else but didn't offer a drink.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I recently flew with Emirates from Sydney to Prague, via Dubai. The flights between Sydney and Dubai were in the new Premium Economy Class, sadly not yet available between Dubai and Prague. The economy class legs of the journey were satisfactory given they were only 6 hours in duration. However the Premium Economy flights were definitely a significant improvement, and in my opinion well worth the extra expense. Bright cabin with wide comfortable seats, excellent service, improved food quality and presentation and the bathrooms in a different league from the economy class product. In every way using Premium Economy class greatly improved my travel experience and turned the long journey into something enjoyable, rather than an endurance test. My hope is that this product can be rolled out to more routes in the near future.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to my physical condition, I fly in Business and always request wheelchair assistance. Emirates treatment and service on my Delhi/Barcelona flight (April 3rd) has been horrible. On the first flight EK 513 from Delhi to Dubai, I notified my situation and asked to the crew that, since the connection time to my flight to Barcelona was 1 hour 55 minutes, they would check that I was picked up from the plane quickly. The cabin staff told me ""don't worry"". Upon arrival they told me that I had to wait because there was no finger but stairs. After a while and seeing how nervous I was getting, a first class attendant approached me and told me that she would take my luggage and help me down the stairs because if I didn't take the bus on the runway, I wouldn't make it to the flight to Barcelona. On the bus there was a person in an Emirates uniform who I asked if she could help me when I got to the terminal to locate a wheelchair because he had very short connection time, he refused! Upon arrival at the terminal there were no wheelchairs, I made it with difficulty to the wheelchair request point and, from there they had me getting on and off several buggies and, luckily, the driver of the last buggy helped me with the luggage to Arrive at the plane after the closing time of the flight.

"Not Verified |  My experience onboard Emirates was a good one. The IFE was great, food was good and so was the cabin service. The airline though sent a 777 with the old cabin from Bengaluru to Dubai, which was not so bad, but made me a bit disappointed. The next flight from Dubai to Washington DC also was served by a Boeing 777, but with the latest cabin with a new, big, modern IFE screen and a brighter cabin, which made a difference for the better. Apart from the old cabin, I found the legroom to be quite a bit lesser than what I initially thought. Perhaps I should try the Airbus A380 if I am to get a better experience. But the 777s were also equally nice, at least in Economy. Since I was flying during Covid time, I was also a tad bit disappointed over no hot towels and menu cards in Economy.

"✅ Trip Verified |  In December 2022 I travelled from Sydney to Dubai with Emirates First Class. I was contacted by the Emirates car transfer company prior to collection and informed them the number of passengers and luggage, but the car that arrived was too small and the driver was rude and unhelpful.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I was quite disappointed given how much I paid for the ticket. I had a business trip in Hong Kong and I returned from Hong Kong to Bangkok. The airport was huge but the Emirates ground service was very poor. There was some issues at the check in counter causing me to wait at least half hour for my turn to check in luggage. The seats at the economy class is good, on par with other airlines. The cabin crews are nice and helpful and it seems the cabin crew are all coming from different countries but I don't any Emirati or Middle Eastern cabin crew.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely atrocious service of the ground staff and call center staff. I was denied boarding by their check-in staff, because I had some minor marks on my passport. The staff kept listing out the 'rules' and 'terms and conditions', and even when I asked for some solutions it was back to the rules; literally no insights When I asked about re-booking it's 'we can't help, you need to contact your travel agent'. The staff showed no compassion and provided no useful advice. I had a return flight; my outgoing flight was from London to India, then my return flight was Bahrain to London. They listed me as a 'no-show' on their 'system' - which means they also canceled my Bahrain - London flight, which I can easily make (I will get a new passport in 2 days' time) and then fly to India to continue my trip as planned (minus a few days).

"✅ Trip Verified |  After being a Skywards member for many years, this time I requested wheelchair assistance. I flew Bangkok to Cape Town and returned from Johannesburg to Bangkok. I was expecting the wheelchair transfers in Dubai to be the usual high standard. Instead of a wheelchair waiting for me as the aircraft opened its doors in Dubai, I was told to walk along the sky bridge and to find a desk that would then provide a wheelchair. I did this and found a group of men who were obviously employed to provide wheelchair assistance standing around talking to each other and did not seem to have any list of passengers who required this assistance. I was told there were not enough wheelchairs and told to walk to another area where there was no seating and I had to stand until an assistant arrived with a wheelchair. I sat in this while we went from one building to another and in the airport train. I was unceremoniously dumped at the seating area at the gate and a very long walk down a corridor and onto the skybridge awaited me. The woman sitting next to me kindly asked it I would like to lean on her arm as we traversed this onto the aircraft. I don't know what would have happened if I had been unable to walk at all. The return trip from Johannesburg to Bangkok was even worse. When we landed in Dubai there were no wheelchairs and I was asked to walk a long distance and up an escalator to an area of seating and told to wait for a golf cart. This did not appear. I was sitting next to a woman whose mobility was even worse than mine and she was in a great deal of pain. We were then told we had to walk to some other area, so the woman and I shuffled off leaning on each other vowing never to fly with Emirates again. This time we were told to wait in an area with no seats at all for a golf cart. I noticed a folded wheelchair up against a wall so I unfolded it and put my companion in it. She was most grateful. No assistance at all from the employees whose job it was to provide assistance. Eventually a golf cart came and I got in. Then there were discussions amongst the so-called assistants, and I was told to get out and wait for a different golf cart. I was the only one in this golf cart and was dumped at the correct gate where I had to walk down the sky bridge to the plane. As I get older I will increasingly need to require wheelchair assistance when I travel alone. But the appalling way I and others were treated at Dubai Airport will certainly influence me when I choose which airline to fly in the future. I go to Africa regularly. Next time I will choose Ethiopian Airlines.

"✅ Trip Verified | I am astonished to read the number of negative reviews this airline receives. I have completed a round trip from South Africa to Thailand and Malaysia on Emirates, and have nothing but praise for their stellar product. Flight from Cape Town to Dubai was on a 777, which admittedly is beginning to show signs of age, but that did not stop the staff from giving excellent service. The other three flights were all on an A380, which was comfortable and made extremely pleasant by very friendly and helpful staff. All flights were on time, and served delicious food and drink to boot. In addition, the Business Class product offers extras such as lounge access and (in my opinion the best of all) chauffeur service, which works like clockwork.

"Not Verified |  We were scheduled to depart at 10.30pm I was travelling with my 10 year old son. We moved away from the gate and was told there was a technical issue so we had to return. Over an hour later we were told it was resolved and we left the gate again. As we were taxiing the pilot came on and said that Narita Airport had decided to conduct runway maintenance so we had to return to the gate again. This was the first problem - this was a lie. Narita Airport does not allow any aircraft to take off after midnight, this is why we could not take off and there is no way that Emirates did not know this. We returned to the gate and waited for an hour with no information. Then they said they would serve dinner - this is at 1am! I had no desire to eat dinner at 1am. With no further information we were told we had to deplane at 3am - so nearly five hours on the tarmac - and the ground staff would deal with us when we got off the plane. When we got off the plane, I was handed a sleeping bag with no explanation. When I asked they said we had to sleep at the gate. Eventually we were told that the flight might depart at 3pm the next day - 17 hours after the scheduled departure. No accommodation was provided or even offered. They announced breakfast at 9.30 am by which time was son was starving hungry anyway, so I had already paid for breakfast myself. Breakfast was a small piece of pizza bread and some water. There was no lunch. They did rebook my connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester, however we had already missed Christmas Eve by this point which was the whole reason we were leaving on December 23rd. Now, I understand that technical issues occur. I can even understand that we might be delayed by 17 hours. However, being forced to wait on the plane for 5 hours when they knew we were never going to depart, being lied to about the reason, not being given accommodation or proper food - these are all things I cannot accept and so wrote a complaint. My request for compensation has now been denied three times. They have said that Article 9 of their Conditions of Carriage says that they do not guarantee departure dates or times. If that is the case - how can any customer trust them to depart at a time and date that they paid for? Good food, good seats, good entertainment system, mediocre cabin crew.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My recent experience with them has been quite disappointing. The cabin crew are less friendly than I remember them to be years back, especially the male crew. I experienced this on all four legs of my recent journey. They felt like more of bouncers (i.e the men), as they didn't smile, weren't friendly or approachable, and instead of telling me ""this way, please,"" as I have always been used to during boarding, one of the men simply got in my way and gestured me to go in the other direction, without uttering a word. I found this to be a bit rude. To add to this, some crew members on various legs of my trip didn't offer me a beverage during snacktime, while they offered my neighbours some. And it's not because I had my headphones on or was asleep or seemed uninterested. They glanced at me and somehow decided I wouldn't be interested in a cuppa? This happened three different times!

"✅ Trip Verified |  My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on November 24th 2022 from Seattle to Dubai, seated in row 19, and sadly it was the experience I was expecting.  This was a 14+ hour flight, and one would think the crew would be friendly and check on the passengers more, however the only time we saw them was during boarding, food service and disembarking and without smiles. After and before the food service the crew were nowhere to be seen. On other flights with other airlines the air hostesses will come by a couple of time with water/ tea/coffee or just even walk by to make sure if anything was needed. I understand people may want to sleep but you can also do it without waking up the passengers. Thirdly, the food was not appetizing, and not only that but if Emirates is releasing the menu on the app with a couple options (veg and non-veg) on the plane I was told I cant have the veg because I didn’t order it, Then why was it an option and it didn’t have anything on the side that said Pre-order. Ended up taking the meal with he chicken which was dry and hard like a baseball. I didn’t eat it. We were served a pizza snack and it wasn’t warmed up well. I am not one who leaves reviews but I understand that Emirates is a well renowned brand and company and my review will not matter to them but at the end of the day it was my hard earned money that I used to pay for my Flight.

"✅ Trip Verified | Though Emirates only operates a handful of flights to and from Milan, it maintains a nice, spacious lounge with ample seating and good selections of food. I could walk around and pick any seat I want in the lounge without having to sit next to strangers. Tables in the dining area were quickly cleared and cleaned after guests left, so they were always ready for the next guests. One unique thing about Emirates was that I could board directly from the lounge, which made things much easier. On board, the A380 was nice. Every seat had a minibar, which was nice. Emirates does not offer full turndown service the way Qatar Airways does, but a mattress pad was provided (like on Japan Airlines) to make a more comfortable bed. The gender specific amenity kit, by Bvlagri, was very nice and useful. Food was good in general, and wine selection was ahead of other airlines, but service was slow and a bit inconsistent.

"✅ Trip Verified |  First time flying business class with Emirates and it was very disappointing. A very early pre-boarding process in Amsterdam, while the crew was waiting in the tiny area as well for the airplane to be cleaned. So 500 People squeezed into a waiting area for an hour. Boarding is messy. Boarding music is terrible and, if delayed, played on repeat for hours. The seat is quite nice. The crew works very hard, but the service is just chaotic and messy with their trays, stuff stacked on top of each other. Meal service starts 2 hours after take off. On the way back used the business lounge in Dubai. It is far from the quality of lounges other airlines have, including most European airlines. Again delayed. Gipsy King music again for the 2 hours on ground during boarding. Poorly informed by the captain and mixed/contradicting info from the cabin crew.

Starting with the Airport, I was forced to check one of my carry-ons due to “no space” on the plane although it was not a full flight and I was made to pay a huge amount of money just for that and what’s worse is that the bag had a lot fragile souvenirs and I risked breaking all of them. Thank goodness it was loaded in Japan and no harm was done and the bag dodged a bullet. I don’t remember Emirates being that needlessly strict. I’m not sure if the airline changed the aircraft because the extra legroom seat that I paid for was different than the one I got as the exit door was in the way so I had to lean a little on the person next to me to get the full legroom feel. It was a long flight but it went smooth and the food was extremely delicious. The flight attendant that was assigned to our row, although efficient, made me feel like an inconvenience as she had very low energy and didn’t seem very enthusiastic to the point that while was pouring me apple juice, the carton ran out of juice while the cup was half full and that’s how she served it without bothering to open another carton. For the whole flight I was waiting for her to pass by us so I can ask the other, much nicer attendant for water and/or assistance whenever I needed something. For some weird reason, the much advertised On Air WiFi did not work which took another point out.",1,2022-12-13,Bahrain,True,good experience starting airport forced check one carry ons due space plane although full flight made pay huge amount money worse bag lot fragile souvenir risked breaking thank goodness loaded japan harm done bag dodged bullet remember emirate needlessly strict sure airline changed aircraft extra legroom seat paid different one got exit door way lean little person next get full legroom feel long flight went smooth food extremely delicious flight attendant assigned row although efficient made feel like inconvenience low energy seem enthusiastic point pouring apple juice carton ran juice cup half full served without bothering open another carton whole flight waiting pas u ask much nicer attendant water assistance whenever needed something weird reason much advertised air wifi work took another point
"✅ Trip Verified |  I have been flying Emirates for 15 years and was a gold member for much of that time. From 2007 - 2012 their customer service was almost unmatched but things have been getting worse over the past 10 years or so and now I would say it is the worst of any airline in the world. I have flown Emirates 3 times this year out of necessity and each time it has been a complete disaster. Emirates has now switched from operating like a typical full service carrier to something more akin to a low-cost airline. Not only do they have 4 fare classes (economy, premium, business & first) but each of those classes is split into 4 types (special, saver, flex & flex-plus). The saver fares usually look too good to be true because they are! If you find a low price on a special or saver fare when booking in advance you may think you got a good deal but try to make any changes to the flight and you will soon find that the airline tries to gauge you for extortionate 'fare differences'. Even if you try to change your flight to one that costs exactly the same as the flight you are on and there are empty seats in your fare class, they will tell you that your 'fare type' is no longer available and extort you for hundreds if not thousands of dollars to make the change. Even if the flight you're on is full and the flight you want to switch to is half empty (something you think the airline would be glad of) they still try to gauge you. If you're lucky enough to get through to customer service, they will not offer you any assistance whatsoever - their job is just to extract as much extra cash from you as they can. I have come to expect this and so avoid Emirates where I can. My latest experience with Emirates customer service was far worse than my already very low expectations. I tried to use the Emirates app to make a change to the flight time. I had a Saver fair so there was a change fee of £100. This was clearly stated in the terms and conditions of the ticket so I was happy to pay. However, when I got to the screen to put in my credit card details, the app crashed. I tried again and the same thing happened. Rather than keep trying to work with a defective app, I called the airline to make the change over the phone. A recorded message said that the airline was extremely busy and that if I was not flying in the next 48 hours, I should hang up and call back later. I complied with this request and hung up the call. As soon as I got back to my hotel room, I got on the laptop to make the change. despite only being a couple of hours later, there was suddenly a 'fare difference' to pay. Since it was the Emirates app that had failed when I tried to make the change and since their call center was too busy to take my call at that time, I was sure that Emirates would do the right thing and match the price from when I had first attempted the change. I thought wrong! I spoke to a hopeless fist line call center worker who could not help so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor said that he did not have any authority to make changes to flights, despite the fact that he told me that he was the most senior person in the airline I could speak to. Eventually, I was put through to another man a second level supervisor (or ""officer"")",5,2022-12-02,United Kingdom,True,flying emirate year gold member much time customer service almost unmatched thing getting worse past year would say worst airline world flown emirate time year necessity time complete disaster emirate switched operating like typical full service carrier something akin low cost airline fare class economy premium business first class split type special saver flex flex plus saver fare usually look good true find low price special saver fare booking advance may think got good deal try make change flight soon find airline try gauge extortionate fare difference even try change flight one cost exactly flight empty seat fare class tell fare type longer available extort hundred thousand dollar make change even flight full flight want switch half empty something think airline would glad still try gauge lucky enough get customer service offer assistance whatsoever job extract much extra cash come expect avoid emirate latest experience emirate customer service far worse already low expectation tried use emirate app make change flight time saver fair change fee clearly stated term condition ticket happy pay however got screen put credit card detail app crashed tried thing happened rather keep trying work defective app called airline make change phone recorded message said airline extremely busy flying next hour hang call back later complied request hung call soon got back hotel room got laptop make change despite couple hour later suddenly fare difference pay since emirate app failed tried make change since call center busy take call time sure emirate would right thing match price first attempted change thought wrong spoke hopeless fist line call center worker could help asked speak supervisor supervisor said authority make change flight despite fact told senior person airline could speak eventually put another man second level supervisor officer

You can lay on your back quite comfortably but I don't know how a bigger person will be comfortable especially on long haul flights. In each of the 4 legs at every meal time, the flight attendant asked me "" do you want to eat dinner/ lunch/ brunch?"". Of course I would. Where would I go for sustenance on a 15 hour flight? It's not like I could jump out the plane for takeout or fix myself a sandwich. Felt like a weird question like I was waiting for a free meal in a soup kitchen.  Meal service was super slow. On one of the legs, the flight attendant set my table for brunch and the actual brunch arrived 45 minutes later, during lunch time. And my vegan brunch was just a Chia seed pudding which was probably dumped into a bowl from a Mason jar so not sure why the delay. The vegan options were quite pathetic and almost unpalatable on 2 of the 4 legs. Just a mush of steamed rice/ noodles and veggies isn't really a vegan meal.

The movie collection was vast but didn't fit my taste. My seat wasn't locked. So, it changed position without pushing the button. However, those minors didn't bother me because of the good value and the great staff. What bothered me is the lack of goodwill of the Emirates on ground service. Emirates offered to reschedule the booked flights because of the Covid-19 pandemic for three years (what was great). However, our daughter became 13 years old during that time and a new more expensive adult ticket was needed for her. However, we saved about 150 Euro for her previous ticket, we had to add another 600 Euro for the new ticket. To get the new ticket kept us almost two hours on the phone with fast speaking call service assistants. On the way back, we had to pay additional 217 Euro for overweight. That was new for us, because we always could have one to two more kilogram per suitcase. Maybe it is standard nowadays, but every weight scale is different, therefore I think airlines good except two kilos more per suitcase. Families seem to be disadvantaged in this concern.

We were then taken to the aircraft in the hope that some passengers might change seats. 20 minutes past with no good news whilst we were just left to stand by the aircraft door. At no point was any offer made regarding accommodation or alternate flight and, again, we were encouraged to accept that our daughter would have to travel next to a random stranger and presumably feed herself hot meals throughout the 7 hour flight.

Inbound (BHX to DXB): Extremely bad service, 3 hours after take off and nothing (not even drinks) were given, my blood sugar started going down and I got dizzy because of that. When meals were served finally, it seemed the attendants forgot to give a lot of people meals (including my seat mate).

"Not Verified |  I had booked return flights with wheelchair service for my 60 year old Mom for AMD to DFW and back. The flight schedule was changed and instead of 3 hours bearable lay-over, now there was a 11 hour lay-over. They gave hotel accommodation but I was still worried due to my mother’s health and age.  While returning from DFW and reaching DXB, they told my mother that she doesn’t have wheelchair booked. Due to less passengers, upon asking for help, they agreed to provide her wheelchair but what if the flight was packed? Strike 3: I talked to customer service about their initial refusal to provide a wheelchair and they had no answer but “Her wheelchair is booked”. So I asked customer service for the instructions that my mother should follow to get back to the airport from hotel and again the only answer to all my questions was “Our staff will be there to assist her everywhere”. After her hotel stay, my mother was dropped at the road-side of the airport with nobody to help. She asked questions to the passing-by people and thank God she was able to find her way into the airport wheelchair counter.

✅ Trip Verified |  My first experience of Emirates new premium economy class. Food and service excellent. Seats however are a little bit firm and not as comfortable as the pictures suggest. Also the recline is quite big so you can feel a little trapped once the person in front refines. Access to three toilets for 50 plus passengers is a real bonus and you get glimpses of the flight deck if that is an interest. I paid very little in cost difference which was the attraction but Emirates economy is very good in any case so May not always be a choice I am willing to pay much extra for.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Wish I had read these reviews. I paid over £2,500 for tickets from London to Dubai to Bangladesh for early next year. I’m travelling with my wife and 2 babies (1 &2.5 years old). The only reason I chose their flights was because it gave the best option of 14 hours in total for flight and transit which is still long with 2 babies but better than 21.5 hours, they suddenly decided to change my original flights, booked only 10 days before, they’ve sent me a text and a short email to say: this is your new itinerary nothing else. I was shocked. How could any airline be so insensitive knowing that these customers are flying with an infant and a 2.5 year old so the least they could do instead of sending us a little text and email giving us no option whatsoever to change or contact them to discuss or be decent to call us at least to see if this was acceptable or not, did we want to change our flights or else cancel and get a refund as they have breached our contract. But nothing and when we tried to call their number in London this guy said he can’t help us with rebooking or a refund but he can put us through to them in Dubai. I hang on and on for 3 hours before realising this was a trick to just get rid of us. I got tired and hung up. There is no other way for us to contact them now at all because when we call their only one number in London you get the due to high volume of calls we can’t answer your call, when I tried the only number given in Dubai nobody answers.

"Not Verified |  After being concerned about our Qantas BC flight to Singapore with their issues, we were really looking forward to flying Emirates BC for the 1st time. Qantas blew Emirates out of the water. Worst business class ever. Really disappointed. You pay a lot to fly business class, so the expectation that something as simple as the food to be hot should be expected. Both flights the food was Luke warm. Can't stand cold food. It maybe the size of the A380 business class, but the whole set up seemed cold. Took off, and it was like a conveyor belt. Seat cushion on for sleep. Food orders taken. Place mat down. Crew were like robots, zero warmth. Qantas do the same, but just felt totally different. More customer interaction and dare I say warmth. 777 flight was a little better but the food was still cold. Sorry unacceptable in business class or even economy for that matter. Not looking forward to our flight from Europe back to Singapore in 6 weeks. When you save to fly business class, when the airline gets it wrong you feel ripped off. Yes they got us there in one piece with our luggage so I suppose I should be happy with that.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled with many airlines until à now and it was the worse service I got. The first time I didn’t get my luggage on arrival and no compensation above all. An airlines who allows itself to plan short connection, and arrives late in Dubai, to the price of leaving your luggages behind. And after complaining to the customer service, this is what you get : “ Dear Miss Bacconnet, Thank you for your correspondence. I regret the inconvenience you experienced when your baggage was not available for collection upon you arrival in Paris on 30 May 2022. Our records indicate that your baggage was unintentionally left behind in Dubai and subsequently returned to you. Compensation for delayed baggage is offered to passengers to assist with the purchase of essential items of an immediate need. Passengers who are residents in the country where the claim has been registered are not eligible for this payment. Delayed baggage compensation also does not cover consequential expenses such as hotel accommodation, transportation, loss of income etc. We are not in a position to offer compensation and recommend that you contact your insurance company for assistance. Thank you for the opportunity to respond. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you on board in the near future under more favourable circumstances. Yours sincerely, Emirates Customer Affairs” Apparently, even though I don’t leave in Paris, I don’t have “essential needs” because my country can its residents all their essential needs. It is well known that when you live in a country, everything is free for you. Like I didn’t pay the hotel because I had to wait for my luggage for almost two hours after someone came to me to let me know it’s not gonna come today so that I missed my train back home. Consequently I had to book a night in a hostel because a hotel in Paris is crazy expansive. And as I didn’t have essentials I had to pay not less than 4€ to rent a ridiculous cheap quality towel.

"Not Verified |  Since it was sudden sandstorm on Sunday 14August 2022,our flight was delayed from Bahrain and then Dubai too. Wen we arrived Dubai Airport then Emirates staff gave us Boarding passes and meal vouchers for another rebooking which was 6 hours later and I asked for lounge or some waiting areas from the staff since I carrying 1 month infant with me along 1 child, she denied saying that lounges are all occupied because all flights are delayed. I again understand that lounge may not be available but she could have shown some empathy and could have tried from her end to facilitate us by saying let me check if possible. I was not informed that there will be no announcements on this airport and she did not even tell that your gate may be in another building for which you will have to go by bus or metro which takes another 30-40 minutes at least. Somehow I found a place to feed my baby which was quite far but concourse B was mentioned on my Boarding pass so I thought its near only we went to relax n feed my baby and later our gate was changed to another building and I did not know it will take such long time to reach there. Running through the way we couldn't manage it to the gate, we missed that flight too. I believe Emirates staff should communicate with the passenger clearly about the important information specially when someone like me who is going on Dubai Airport first time.

"Not Verified |  I have flown Emirates extensively in the Lisbon-Dubai route and I find their product rather consistent. This last time check-in took a bit too much than I would expect for Business, but security fast-track works well and is convenient. In Lisbon Emirates uses the TAP lounge which is a bummer as other than being very crowded at all times, it is located before passport control (Schengen area) which forces people to leave much earlier than boarding start. If flying Business in the Boeing 777-300 do choose the front mini-cabin (first 2 rows before the door) as all the 300+ Economy passengers board through the door before the aft cabin leading to an annoying 1h boarding process with people passing by. Food and crew are usually great and very helpful and friendly. At Dubai very easy process to go through priority passport control and to reach the complimentary limo service, all very efficient. I have found some drivers to be quite rude and/or driving dangerously - Emirates should improve their standards for this personnel.

"✅ Trip Verified | Service is below sub standard. I travelled with my 2 daughters of 2 and 7 years. I bought my seat at the time of booking and the system wouldn’t let me to do the same for my daughters. At the time of online check in, I found out that my daughters were seated 7 rows ahead of me on their own which shocked me. Furthermore, I raised my concerns to the officer at the check-in desk. Her seat allocation was more terrible than the system. She allocated me in the middle seat, 2 year at the aisle and 7 year aisle right across making her to sit with a stranger. I was frightened to hear that bad news and had to escalate the issue to the supervisor. Finally, after 20-25 minutes of waiting, supervisor made me (compulsion) to sit with my daughters 7 seats ahead of my paid chosen seat. At least, it was a big relief for me before boarding. Money paid for my chosen seat was gone into Emirates account and no refund was made until now. More paper work following to claim it and a waste of time, so let Emirates enjoy that undeserved money. Service offered by the airline was below standard when compared to the rest of Middle Eastern Carriers and other standard carriers. Families travelling with kids were of least to no concern by the crew. However, I have to admit that Emirates managed to arrive the destination on time.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Checked in at Bergen for flight Oslo with SAS connecting to Dubai with Emirates. Arrived early. Waited at gate in Oslo before flight started to board and was 2nd in line. Bags were checked all the way through to Dubai, where we would then have a rest and get a flight to Melbourne the following day. Attempted to board and told our tickets had been cancelled - by us! Somehow in the air from Bergen, we decided to cancel our own tickets and delay seeing our 4 children and give up a weekend in Dubai - seems unlikely. Argued the point but no interest in listening to us and the flight left without us. We were not told where to go, who to contact, how to get any help and we had to wait for hours for our luggage to be returned to us after it was taken off the plane. We spent two days stranded in Oslo airport with no help from Emirates at all. Our travel agent confirmed that it was in fact Emirates that cancelled our tickets - for being a “no show” which is 100% wrong and we can prove this. We spent money on hotel, footed and lost money in Dubai from prebooked accommodation. Emirates would not give us anything in compensation. Flight home was empty / half full. No offer of upgrade or anything at all from customer service (or lack of customer service!). After a terrible flight home, straight through to Melbourne we were now a day late due to the airline. We lost a days work and had to re-schedule deliveries at additional cost to our business. After several attempts to write, email and call emirates customer service on return to Melbourne, we have had zero response! The lack of service and care for customers is disgraceful. I was prepandemic a frequent international flyer and in 20 years I have never seen such a poor display. I will never fly this airline again. Emirates is an appalling company that cares nothing for the customer experience. They do not care for Australian passengers - it’s all about looking after their own profits. Fly at your own risk as they will cost you money and care less.

"✅ Trip Verified |  This is the most unpleasant business class travel experience I have ever had. My check-in luggage is missing, despite I confirmed with the check-in counter in Dubrovnik multiple times that my luggage will be delivered automatically to Japan without any manual transfer procedure required in Dubai. The WIFI (cost 19.9 usd) I bought onboard doesn't work most of the time. When I went to the toilet shortly before landing, the attendant reluctantly open the door for me. But he kept pushing by saying ""do it really quick"" and even knocked the door irritatedly. He didn't apologise even after I asked him to use proper English and better manner. The company changed the aircraft without notice. I book the aisle seat but it ended up as a window seat. (Another attendant helped me change the seat.

"✅ Trip Verified |  In the last 4-years, Emirates customer service has become one of the worst. I doubt they are any better than a 2-star service. Their airport staffs are either rude or cold. Their in-flight food service is mediocre. Although, the food is above average. They offer minimal service when it comes to offering water or drinks during the flight. I tried upgrading using family account points, a feature with Emirates. It is more or less a scam scheme designed to pool all your points in your family account. The idea is you can upgrade your journey or family members' journey using the family account. However, you cannot access these points when you want to upgrade. So you are left with no points in your account and storing all your points in your family account, and you can't use them. Emirates airport staffs and cabin crews are so poorly trained. Both Airline check-in staff, Cabin Crew and support staff have no clue how the family account works. I heard 4-different versions of the policies. They send me round in circles on 2 different trips, and the issue still remains unresolved after a week. As a gold member, I get a pleasant smile and a warm welcome, but that is just faking a few words that have no value whatsoever. Anytime I requested any help, I more or less got nothing for being Gold. The only thing that remains for being Gold is Fast Check-in in the Dubai airport and a few other airports outside the UAE, Lounge access, and sometimes faster delivery of your check-in baggage. There was a time Emirates was better or as good as Qatar Airways. Overall, EK's poor customer service let it down big time.

"✅ Trip Verified |  At Algiers airport, the lounge is lifeless.  In the plane, the power receptacle is broken on my seat but luckily no one was sitting next to me to use his. The live TV did not work and the images are distorted. The live TV displays a few frames then freezes for a minute or so before displaying more frames. I was trying to watch the football game between ManU and Chelsea. The food (we were fasting) they left by your seat and then it took another 15 minutes to bring nuts and drinks after Maghrib. I just wanted soup for Iftar. In addition, when I was asked to choose my entree, it was not available. The seat I had 11A was very noisy. Usually they distribute pouches with socks, toothbrush and toothpaste and a blind mask in addition to ear plugs which would have been helpful. After all this is business class. The only bright thing in this upgrade is that the hostesses were brilliant and even tolerated my displeasure with these inconveniences in a nice way. In any case, this is the worst business class experience flying Emirates ever. Most likely it will be my last at least on this route. This is their reply: Dear Mr Boutrid, Thank you for your correspondence of 31 May 2022 regarding Emirates flight EK 758 from Algiers to Dubai on 28 April. I am concerned to learn of your disappointment with the lounge at Algiers airport. This lounge is operated by a service provider. Regrettably, not all lounge operators have the selection of food and beverages or ambience that we offer in our Emirates Lounges. However, your feedback is noted and has been shared with the relevant team for their information. Through emirates.com we do advise customers that for technical reasons we are unable to provide Wi-Fi, mobile phone, mobile data and live television services on every flight, or guarantee a continuous service. Emirates' liability is therefore limited. However, I acknowledge that this added to your disappointment. With regard to your request for the mixed grill, we always aim to match the quantity of choices with the predicted passenger preferences. While we do our utmost to meet all passenger requests, sometimes there may be shortages of a particular meal choice due to previous passenger selection. Shortages of a particular meal are continuously monitored in order to adjust ratios accordingly for future flights. It is my understanding that got your first choice of starter (potato soup), your preferred dessert, the chocolate caramel tarte, and opted for the beef meal instead. On another note, Business Class kit bags are offered on flights over 3 hours 30 minutes that depart between the hours of 22:00 to 05:00 and on all flights over 9 hours regardless of the departure time. However, certain toiletry items are available in the lavatories for the comfort of our passengers and may also be requested from our cabin crew.

"✅ Trip Verified |  It was a round trip with Emirates from Delhi to Dubai and antagonistic experience in both journeys. Ground staff at Dubai was very rude and unhelpful whereas in India the check in was way easier despite of huge rush. We were stuck and struggling for self check in (which we were guided again and again by the limited staff available) and finally after half an hour when our check in baggage got stuck on the belt and we again have to helplessly ask for help for which the lady at the counter replied us to wait for 2-3 minutes. After 10 minutes when nobody turned up my husband reminded the same lady at the counter that we need help to which she replied I am on some other report and we should proceed towards manual counter. We were shocked! My husband reminded her that our baggage is stuck to which she responded with irritation and called some technical staff to provide our baggage. Then we proceeded towards manual counter where again with technical glitches our check in was done in half an hour when all our documents were properly in place. In short more than an hour to check in at Dubai airport with Emirates without rush whereas in India within an hour we were done with check in, security and immigration!

"✅ Trip Verified | MXP-JFK-MXP in F. I found a solid product and comfort on board but service from the staff was just OK. There is a lack of personal touch throughout the whole flight experience from check-in procedure that was very cold both ways to the inflight mode. I always felt like an economy class pax on the ground both at check-in and in the lounge both in Italy & USA. Far different from what you feel flying QR in business for instance. Return flight on A6-EEA was disappointing because the aircraft was showing his age: my suite was completely worn out, sliding doors broken. EK should pay attention to this details and make sure everything is renewed especially in premium cabins where there is too much difference between aircraft to aircraft for A380's in their fleet. The food was very good quality in both legs. JFK-MXP flight was below average because of the service that was either too slow for the main meal or too rushed during breakfast.

"✅ Trip Verified | Our first flight since the pandemic. Check in at LGW was quick and efficient. Made our way to the Emirates lounge as we had a couple of hours to spare. Service was good in the lounge and after about 15 minutes they served a hot lunch. The Goan Chicken Curry was pleasant. Flight boarded and departed on time. My wife and I had seats 14E and 14F which are ideal for a couple travelling together. At the time of travel masks were mandatory, Emirates provided spare masks and sanitizer. The food service on Emirates used to be quite drawn out but with the new system they take the meal selection from the passengers on a hand held device and it seems to be delivered in quite an efficient manner. I chose the Arabic Mezze, which was very tasty followed by the Beef Tenderloin, which was also good. Good choice of wine available.

"✅ Trip Verified | Superb service from Emirates. I had to cancel my flight due to illness only 2 weeks before departure and phoned the Lisbon office. After pressing 2 buttons I was talking to a rep after less than 2 minutes. Much to my surprise, for a base ticket, he said I was entitled to a refund and sent me a refund form. Nothing arrived for a month so I again phoned and the mistake I had made in completing the refund form was explained and another sent. After only 2 weeks a partial refund for 'no show' was credited to my account and when I queried why 'no show' for a cancellation I received an apologetic mail confirming full refund which duly arrived after only 10 days.

"✅ Trip Verified |  A business trip from Sydney to Zurich and then back to Brisbane, code share with Qantas. Things that impressed me included the superb food and wine on all sectors (incl a nice printed menu and wine list), the wonderful Emirates First Class Lounges in Dubai (especially their prime lounge), the speedy and efficient boarding and the good cabin crews. Not so good was trying to get to a toilet in the middle of the night and having to make my way past lots of drunken passengers filling the bar area at the back of the A380 - which is also the area where the toilets are. I suggest this Lounge area could be made a barista coffee lounge instead (as much as I like a glass of wine). All flights pretty much on time.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Only the second time I choose to fly Emirates, so I will not make a fast decision as to use this airline again or not. But I have to say that in all the years I have been flying business, the CDG - DXB sector was a complete disgrace. From the chaotic boarding in Paris when all first and business class passengers were held at the gate for 25 minutes (apparently for no reasons except that some sort of VIP showed up at some point and cut the line), without so much as an announcement from the person in charge. Once everyone was on board, the first announcement from the captain was about an hour delay in getting a takeoff slot. As we pushed back, their APU went out, no lights and aircon and back to the gate. Then some very vague information from the flight deck on some repairs being done, and another slot waiting time. Anyway the whole deal lasted 3 hours. Ok, that is a technical problem, it happens and that is the way it is. What bothered me during the whole time was the complete disdain of the cabin crew for the passengers. As a matter of facts, most of them seemed to enjoy the delay and were having some very long and loud conversations with some apparent friends in the aisles. The flight finally took off. And this is when the cabin crew showed its complete inability to handle the most basic service. Absolutely no care for the passengers, and except for some meal served in a hurry (during which I actually had to beg for a glass of wine previously ordered ) we only got to see them once in a while during the whole 7,5 hours. I want to think that this was a bad timing, or else. On the other end, the second leg of the flight from DXB to Moscow was excellent, and I actually found out how much was missing on the first leg then: Friendly and helpful cabin crew, good service. After all this is what we ask for in a flight! My rating will be below at 5/10.

When I arrived at the Emirate ticketing counter in order to obtain my boarding pass, I experienced a bad situation which I have never had with any other airlines. The ticketing lady had a very bad attitude told me to show her my Covid test result which I did, then asking for Vaccination card that I responded that I am USA citizen and there is no need to have this card, which she started talking loud and being so rude, finally I found my card and passed it to her. After that I was glad that the issue was resolved and now she would process my luggage. I was wrong. She laid back at her chair and doing nothing. Finally I said to her this checking takes long time, please process my luggage. At the end I went to her team leader and explained her behavior. I am sure that the leader would not do anything to correct his group attitudes, because all of them are the same and they do not know any better, but I am sure that Emirates will lose more customers as times pass.

"✅ Trip Verified | They cancelled my initial flight from KHI to DXB and rebooked the flights which ended up me having 15 hours layover in Dubai. KHI-DXB, check in was friendly, flight was on time, clean plane, food was outstanding for a flight not even 2 hours long, crew was very friendly and attentive. Blankets and extra pillow were given. Landed in Dubai, went to the Dubai connect desk as it says on their website that if you have more than 10 hours layover, Emirates will provide you accommodation, at the desk, the guy was rude and straight up said Karachi office should have booked you earlier (Karachi office is the one that told me to contact Emirates at Dubai as they have no authority to book anything with Dubai Connect) and I was also told that even a prior booking was made, it would have been cancelled because accommodation is only available for passengers who bought tickets worth more than $1000 USD. Then I went back to the connection desk, explained the whole situation all over again, guy at the desk started blaming me that I am the one who chose to have a longer layover so it's not Emirates problem, he kept ignoring that key information that ""Emirates is the one who cancelled the flight from KHI to DXB, not me"". I have to admit, I became a Karen when he told me Emirates can't offer you anything, no compensation no food, nothing for a 15 hours layover. I refused to listen to him any further and demanded to see a manager right away, he ran back and got the manager at the desk, manager was extremely polite and apologetic, instructed to hand me over 2 meal vouchers immediately (previously I was told Emirates do not have any meal voucher offers etc, so that was the lie). So guys, if you want to be treated fairly by Emirates, you gotta fight hard. DXB to CDG, flight was on-time, full. Crew was very attentive, plane was spotless, food was disgusting. They served feta cheese sandwiches, they were absolutely inedible and were freezing cold as well that it hurts you teeth. Then the lights were switch off so it was good sleep with enough legroom. Breakfast was served an hour before landing and main hot breakfast was inedible as well, fruit portion was fresh but the bread roll was so cold that I couldn't slice or bite it (should learn from Turkish, they serve soft warm rolls). I have also noticed many people didn't eat the hot portion of the breakfast. I have to give a shout-out to one particular crew member, she handled the situation very well when she was yelled at by a grumpy middle age man when she asked him, if he would like to have a breakfast, he started yelling at her that ""no, I'm sleeping, can you see, stop yelling into my ears"".

"✅ Trip Verified | On reading all the post COVID reviews of Emirates, I need to take a contrary stance to all the complaints and mumbles. It was my first Emirates experience in 3 years, and as far as I was concerned nothing had changed, apart from the boarding procedure in Dubai which was nothing short of shambolic - but that is the airport, not the airline. As a direct result of the ineptitude of the gate staff we pushed back 1 hour 20 mins late. No matter. The service was friendly and efficient - nothing was too much trouble - and the food and drink really good. One doesn’t often have memorable meals on board any aircraft (preparation of same must be trying in the extreme), but the lunch served was top notch. A bonus in business class on board an A380 is the on board bar area, once again, service was excellent.

"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the worst experience that I've ever had with any company. My flight from NY to Dubai was delayed. After arriving late to Dubai for my connection flight to Male, I was informed by Emirates staff to go to luggage claims to get my luggage for my next emirates flight to Male. My luggage never came through after 40 mins. I informed an Emirates employee and they claimed that my luggage was already loaded onto my next flight. Upon going through customs, I missed my flight, so I was stuck in Dubai. I was forced to wait in 3 different long lines for a total of 5 hrs, just to be told that because I was a no show, I had to pay a $1200 fee.

"✅ Trip Verified |  We were eligible for Dubai connect service wherein we would be accommodated for the duration of our 9 hour transit in Dubai if we have a connecting Emirates flight. I was travelling for the first time with my newborn and with covid being stressful enough and all the paperwork required to travel, Emirates whipped up a whammy by not arranging for me transit visa even after I organised this a month in advance as directed by Emirates Dubai connect. Their incompetence gave me a hard time travelling with my baby who was very tired after a long flight and since we trusted Emirates notifications, we got to the airport desk to find out our visas were not organised and had to wait 2 hours in the airport for this. I could have easily paid for my visa weeks in advance and had a hassle free experience but even with repeated enquiries with Emirates customer service, I was told the visa was complimentary and not to worry about it. Truly horrifying experience and they never managed to compensate their messing up with anything. I had to pay for my airport hotel stay as we were not willing to wait two hours for just visa processing and then going out of the airport for their complimentary stay. Also, the fact that Dubai airport is so huge makes things more difficult with a baby to be walking a lot.

My return flight got cancelled due to COVID and I requested a refund so I can book a flight home with another airline. Not only did they refund only about 20% of the price I paid but they also didn't refund my miles I used for this flight. In my opinion this is very misleading advertising.

"✅ Trip Verified |  We had the most horrific experience with Emirates travelling from Spain to Sydney. Our flight was delayed by an hour from Barcelona. We let the crew know multiple times that we had a connection to catch. They told us not to worry, there'll be ground crew waiting for us once we land and will make sure we don't miss our connection. But #Emirates had already cancelled our next flight after an hr into our seven 7 hr flight, this was 6 hrs before landing. Once we landed there was no crew waiting so we ran to catch the connection until mid-way the #Emirates personnel appeared telling us about the cancellation. They're rude and ignorant to the fact that we were sleep deprived, tired and could not grasp why no effort was made to make up for the 1 hour delay or contact the ground crew. Also both my partner & I had picked up a cold virus (not Covid, got the negative PCR) and felt horrible. We were both feverish, barely managing to speak and the crew treated us poorly. First they gave us seats far away from each other twice. I couldn't understand how they could make the same mistake twice. Second they told us we can't get the exit row seat, we'd paid extra for. They told me, it wasn't their responsibility to refund the money and I should request if from Emirates.  I just requested that we wouldn't be seated near any small babies and they said fine. They kept telling us to collect our luggage, but with the condition my partner and I were in and the fact that my feet had already started swelling up, it was impossible. So we said no. Since no one was helping and it was 3 am, we thought to go and check in to our hotel & sleep. We were already at our limits but thought we make the best of it, go visit the Dubai Expo and all. But things just started getting worst. We were in nightmarish state until we got home. We had to walk for an hour to get to the shuttle that would take us to the hotel. The Emirates crew at the Airport entrance couldn't help us with Expo tickets, cause they didn't care. We had been given one meal voucher per person for 24 hours. And the hotel had no amenities. After multiple arguments, the meal problem was fixed, which wasn't that useful cause the quality of the food was so bad that all the passengers in the hotel were ordering deliveries. We'd to go and buy clothes, toothbrush, deodorant, etc for ourselves which was a waste of money. The hotel couldn't even be rated at 2 stars and there was always at least one person arguing and shouting with the staff and complaining. We survived the whole ordeal and got to the plane to find couple of things that we were assured were fine, were actually not. We ended being seated beside a baby that cried for 10 hours of our flight without exaggeration, there were empty seats at the end of the plane, they just didn't bother to check for us. I did ask for a change of seat at the gate and in flight and every time I was told there were no empty seats. We arrived at Syd airport in a chaotic situation to collect our luggage.

"✅ Trip Verified |  This was a poor experience from start to finish.  Arrived at the airport to find there was a four-hour delay to the flight. Emirates, however, did not check in bags so no one could go through security or otherwise move to an area with seats available (there were about 30 seats in the area for 200+ passengers). There was very little communication about what problem, if any, caused the delay. Ultimately, Emirates did begin check-in and then began a shuffle of repeated delays until, about seven hours later, Emirates cancelled the flight. Very little communication. ""Maybe there will be a flight tomorrow."" Called Emirates and no answer. Tried online chat without success. Ultimately turned to twitter to get rebooked (had onward flight). This in turn led to the agent trying to charge me an additional several thousand dollars because of fare differential between flying days. I pushed back hard on that, but got the sense Emirates simply sought to profit. Agent tried to put me on a flight in which I would miss my connection to a city served only once every five days by air. Emirates, unlike other airlines, won't book passengers on cancelled flights onto other airlines. Ultimately, Emirates added an additional flight the following day. Told us to get to airport four hours before, but then wouldn't check-in rebooked flight until two hours before so the two flights wouldn't get confused (why then have us in area with no seats and tell us to just stand there for several hours?). Onboard, seats were cramped. My child got a ""kids meal"" she didn't ask for which consisted of one burnt chicken nugget! Service was lackluster.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall the experience was good while on the plane. However getting my luggage was a nightmare! I as well as almost all of the passengers had to wait for over one hour staring at the carousel for our luggage to come out. We landed on time and going through customs was very fast. Arrival was at about 9 pm, I was done with customs by 9:20 pm, BUT I had to wait at carousel 1 from 9:20 pm until 10:45 to get my luggage. Although Emirates may say that they're not responsible for what happens outside the airline, the passenger is charged a fee for going through Newark Airport, and therefore the airline is also responsible. One other issue which may seem unimportant, but it actually is very important: The entertainment is extremely difficult to use as I when I played a movie a radio station presenter came on with advertisements.

"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a trip from London to Muscat and then Muscat to Dubai for a week before returning to the UK. Emirates left us stranded in Muscat Airport. They had cancelled the flight and not even notified us of this cancellation. They had just put us on another flight 40 hours later without telling us. We turned up to the airport and the flight did not exist. There was no help desk at the airport, their App was down and we couldn't get through to customer service in Oman or the UAE. We tried calling customer service in the UK, and were still not put through to anyone 40 minutes later. Bearing in mind, we were having to use our UK mobiles abroad. We had another British couple come up to us who hear our conversation and were going through exactly the same thing. I am over six months pregnant and this was meant to be a honeymoon for us because our original wedding and honeymoon were cancelled due to COVID. In the end we had to rent a car to drive over the border as there weren't any flights to the UAE for 12 hours and we did not want to spend the night in the airport when I was six months pregnant. We tried to complain in Dubai & we were told they couldn't do anything, we had to report it via the website upon completion of our full trip when we arrived back in the UK. I lodged a complaint & we have just received the below response, which takes no accountability and tries to pass the buck to FlyDubai. Firstly, they are part of the same group and secondly, we booked our tickets through Emirates & they took full payment for the whole itinerary. Therefore, we are their customer & we are nothing to do with FlyDubai. They offered us a measly 10,000 miles each, which costs them nothing & is completely worthless since their restructure of airmiles a few years ago. You need a min. 50-100K to upgrade. Emirates response: Thank for your correspondence and naturally, I regret to learn that you were affected by a schedule change and that you only found out when you arrived at the airport. I do appreciate the inconvenience you were caused, especially as I understand that you are pregnant. If I may explain that you booked a ticket which included two different airlines. Although there is a partnership, Emirates and FlyDubai are two separate companies and Emirates have no control over the operation of their flights and vice versa. In this instance, the schedule change occurred to your flight from Muscat operated by FlyDubai; whilst I am not aware why their proposed flight EK2033 on 5 November was removed from their schedules in advance of travel, I would like to explain that unfortunately, there are rare occasions when these cannot be avoided due to operational or commercial requirements, or other unforeseen circumstances. That being said, I note that you experienced difficulties when you tried to contact us and I would like to take this opportunity to apologise on behalf of Emirates, as well as our partner FlyDubai. Whilst we are unable to offer any reimbursement of expenses incurred as a consequence of a cancellation of a flight operated by another airline, I would suggest you contact your private travel insurers, as standard travel insurance policies usually cover such situations. Nevertheless, as a gesture on our part to apologise for the negative impression you have been left with on this occasion, I have credited 10,000 goodwill miles to both your Skywards accounts.

"Not Verified |  Great and consistent service given by the crew, especially the steward serving the cabin from row 24 till 36. He helped with finding space in the overhead bins for cabin bags, was very friendly and motivated, and provided excellent service. During the entire flight he paid attention on passengers wearing their face mask, and made remarks to the ones not wearing it. In the past (before Covid19), I experienced some flights where service was lacking and unsatisfied, but this was a pleasant experience. Only negative point is the self check-in at Dubai Airport. People are guided to self check-in machines, also elderly and less frequent flyers, big families, and it takes very long time to have their check-in completed. Especially when they have excess baggage and already half of the bags have been send through. After completing check in, still have to queue up for passport and PCR verification at another Emirates desk, which makes the self check-in less convenient.

✅ Trip Verified | This was my first and worst experience to fly with Emirates. My previous flight going back to USA was business class and I was provided with a defective seat and I complained about it through their website. They did not bother to refund me for that trip.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I reunited in Seychelles in August 2021 after being separated by the pandemic. We had planned to return to the Philippines where she is a citizen. Upon checking in for our first flight with Emirates, the supervisor said I needed a visa since I was a USA citizen. We attempted to explain that Philippines allows a visa on arrival for foreign spouses traveling with their Filipino spouse under the Balikbayan program. We showed our original apostilled marriage certificate as proof. However, the supervisor stated their system did not list these other provisions. We attempted to show multiple IATF resolutions that the Balikbayan had been allowed for several months, but she stated their system was updated daily. We agreed to follow up during normal business hours since this was Friday night. When I asked for documentation regarding my offloading, the supervisor indicated she couldn't provide this and that I'd have to make an online complaint. We were able to confirm by phone and email from the Bureau of Immigration that I should be allowed entry with my wife. We then showed this documentation to different Emirates supervisors at the airport who expressed confusion as to why I was prohibited to board in the first place. They agreed to independently confirm with Emirates airport staff in Philippines and the airport immigration officials. After they did, the airport supervisors confirmed we could rebook our flights and I would be able to board. We incurred thousands of dollars of extra travel expenses while obtaining this confirmation. And our connecting airlines refused to refund us our tickets without documentation as to why I was prohibited to board. When I requested this documentation from the online complaint system, I did not receive a clear response about the matter for 10 days. And that response added that the Balikbayan program didn't apply to me since I wasn't a Filipino even though I had already provided them emails from the Philippines BOI and the Emirates airport staff confirming I should be allowed to travel. I spent the next month continuing to email, resubmit documentation, and call anyone at Emirates who'd listen without any success. I did not receive any corrected documentation about the offloading, any financial compensation or flight credits, not even an apology acknowledging their initial mistake! Each time they continued to cordially reiterate that they took ""the matter seriously"" and ""have nothing further to add."" International travelers, especially Filipinos, should beware flying Emirates! They're playing the role of immigration without the knowledge or authority to do so. The online complaint system for Emirates is a travesty of a mockery! You can only upload 2 documents at a time. And you can't make multiple submissions without waiting for Emirates to reply. A week or two later. There's no one you can talk to about matters like this by phone either! I asked to speak with supervisors and managers multiple times without any success. Each time they referred me to the (useless) online complaint system. I don't even know why they bothered to send me delayed replies.

No customer should be told that they cannot rebook with another airline after an airline has breached they ticket contract or else they would not receive a hotel voucher. I believe this is the era of choice? The customer doesn’t put themselves in the unfortunate position of an airline being in breach of their airline ticket. And should a customer then choose another airline to reach their destination, the airline should know that the customer did not choose to have to rebook a flight. Nevertheless, the flight a customer chooses should be entirely up to them, given the option. Emirates should never try to hold people hostage after they mess up!  Customers should never be ridiculed for not choosing an airline they no longer trust.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Cabin crew were amazing, the flight from ORD to Dubai was great, the airplane was spotless, food was average, or below average but the economy seats and entertainment were above average. The flight from Dubai to Cairo was almost at equal standing, bathrooms were dirty most of the time though, the main problem that will prohibit me from recommending this airline to anyone is the experiences that I had with their ground crews in Chicago and in Dubai. Counter check-in and package drop off process overall with Emirates were the least efficient out there between the other lines that were checking in at the same time, needless to say that I spent almost 45-60 mins to finalize this step while the whole infamous TSA passport control process took less than 15 mins from start to finish on that busy day. When I finally made it to the check-in counter and I presented my Emirates compliant (not country-specific, Emirates ask for more than that) PCR test, they questioned whether or not I meet the time requirement simply because they compared the sample collection date and time in (CST) with the final destination departure time which was in Dubai local time without accounting for the time difference, after explaining that she took the test and disappeared for 10 mins before returning with the stamp of approval. Right after that she printed our 3 boarding passes for the trip to Dubai and beyond and asked to place our two carry-ons and two backpacks containing our personal items (our laptops, tablets, snacks, medicine, toys, and a change of cloth for our 4-year-old toddler) she stated that they will all be treated as carry-ons and that we were only allowed to bring two of them on board, and that if we don’t we will need to pay $200.00 in extra fees, or we can take our backpacks and check-in our carry-ons, she explained that this carry-ons restriction were a company policy imposed due to Covid, what does Covid has to do with the carry-ons and personal items allowance policy? I never had this experience ever with any other airline including my previous flights thru Emirates & Etihad, no one ever considered my laptop carrying bag as a carryon it was always listed as a personal item which I was allowed to bring on board to stow underneath my seat, I was in a state of shock and I told her that those carry-ons contained items with rechargeable batteries but that didn’t seem to sway her mind, I was in no position to argue at that point and took as much as I could from those rechargeable items form those carry-ons stuffing it into our backpacks just to follow my own safety protocols, on flight I saw many passengers boarding the airplane with their carry-ons and backpacks, and I highly doubt that they paid the $200 they wanted us to pay at the counter! Finally, the point where I completely snapped asking to see the supervisor on-site is when she-alongside another colleague of hers stated that my toddler' aviation approved child seat was not allowed inside the cabin and then they tried to charge me for an extra fourth seat claiming that to bring this on-board I’ll have to pay for an extra seat! I was like my child is 4 years old, we paid for his seat ticket of which we will place this child's seat! nothing changed their mind until the supervisor came, and I told her that we have three tickets for all 3 passengers, and she agreed with our point of view.

"Not Verified |  Their customer service is absolutely atrocious. Their website is not updated and they do not take responsibility for lacking to keep the passengers up to date with Covid travel requirements. I booked my flight two months in advance and checked the Emirates website daily in preparation for it. I am fully vaccinated but still needed a negative covid result, no problem, I got it done. When I got to the airport they said the covid result needs to be stamped. Turns out, all labs in the USA are FDA regulated and do not stamp their results for authorization. The only place that does so is inside the airport, by appointment and costs $175. I learned all of this as I was checking in for my flight. So there is obviously no time to make it and I had to miss my flight. Normally, airlines take responsibility for this and accommodate the passenger by rebooking them free of charge. Not Emirates, their reservations/customer service first said that the next flight is 11 days out, and then gave me no choice but to pay another $2000 to book a seat.

He booked Emirates hoping that they provide what they promise during this pandemic (safe flights, hygienic, booking half the flight's capacity, etc) but my dad had a horrible experience. The flight was fully booked which was quite bothersome at a time when everyone around the world are practising social distancing, the faucets in both the lavatories in his proximity were overflowing and I was told that the crew had been wearing the same masks throughout the 13-14 hour flight. This is an epitome of how Emirates treats its non-premium class as the ""cattle-class"" and that basic hygiene and comfort don't really matter for those who decide to fly at a lower rate. Really ashamed at Emirates for the inequality that they show. During these unprecedented times, they must take into account the passenger's health and safety rather than looking at profits.

"✅ Trip Verified | This is not a premium airline anymore. The days of Emirates being a premium airline are long gone. By now their planes are old, seats and Inflight entertainment systems are broken. On the way up to Dubai 2 out of three seats has sound only in 1 ear. And one seat could not stay in position. The touch screen did not work. On the way back 1 seat and 1 sound system did not work out of three. They charge heavily for wifi and they charge significantly for a seat in front. At a rate where other airlines offer premium economy, Emirates just let you sit a couple of seats in front. European and US carriers by now have closed the gap and surpassed Emirates offering better wifi, premium economy and more innovative entertainment systems (Delta lets you watch from your own iPad). KLM flies this route with brand new 787's. But where an airline should make the real difference, Emirates fails even harder. Service. They get stuck in organizational bureaucracy. Emirates call centre gave you the wrong information? Your problem. That issue cost 200 euros? Your problem. The manager says no. Can I speak to that manager? No. Self-service check-in doesn't work? Your problem. Go stand in another line of self-service machines. Still doesn't work? Your problem. Go stand in the back of the line at the classic check-in counter (after spending 30 mins waiting for machines that don't work)? Can't check you in before you do a covid fast test. Go to a very badly signed fast test area. Everybody there is already checked in?

On every occasion they promised that someone would get back to us directly, of course no one ever did!

On the airport and on the flight as well I've seen sick people, people who were coughing.  When I was flying out to Australia countries have started to introduced lockdown measures so I have decided to move my return flight forward (to make sure I don't stuck on the other side of the world). Whilst Emirates guaranteed ticket flexibility to people who were travelling during this period (they let you change the travel time) I was disgusted by the fact that if you change your return flight Emirates will charge you for a one way ticket which is double the price of a return ticket. So instead of you only paying for the difference between your new ticket and the old ticket you also have to pay for the difference between a single trip and round trip which is absolutely ridiculous and I don't think it's at all acceptable. The Emirates website was saying that all tickets are sold out for they flight I've chosen and on other flight I would have had to pay even more so I bought a ticket from Qantas (which turned out to be on an Emirates flight) I've submitted a cancellation request on my original Emirates flight on 20th March and still hasn't received any response.

"Not Verified |  We had a business class flight from Auckland to Vienna booked for April 20. Obviously Corona crisis happened and we all know the story how almost all flights including this one was cancelled. The terms of the ticket clearly stated that they will refund full amount if they cancel the flight. As other reviewers had mentioned as well, they have since changed their terms so that all refunds are subject to cancellation terms regardless of if they cancel or the client cancels. Thus they are refusing to refund and try to offer their vouchers instead. Being a business class flight for 4 persons it's a fairly substantial amount. Let's consider the facts for a moment.

We contacted the Emirates customer information at Perth Airport for further information. It was confirmed that our flight was cancelled and we were told that as we were no longer a customer with Emirates how we got home was not a concern of Emirates. The phone was then hung up. We got home eventually with Qatar Airways where we had to pay twice the normal cost for regular seats. Since getting home we have been offered vouchers which we have refused saying we want a refund of the cost of the return flight. We have been told that any refund (if offered) may take many months and it is unlikely that Emirates will agree to a full refund for the return flight which they cancelled.

"✅ Trip Verified | Fort Lauderdale to Bangalore via Dubai. I had great expectations after learning that this was the number one airline in the world. It is far from being so, it doesn’t even qualify to be within the first 50, unfortunately. The customer service officials are so ill informed that they can hardly be of help to the customers.

So then I called up to cancel the ticket the customer service diverted me to another website and made me fill out the entire form and submit cancellation. He said it is going to take two weeks for the refund, which was fair. Emirates is misusing the disaster to its advantage and abusing the customers. Now they say it is going to take 90 days to refund the amount. Now there is no way I can get back without being refunded the amount. Their responses are very poor.

"Not Verified |  My wife and I recently flew Emirates EK345 Brisbane to Prague via Dubai 23.03 2020. It was the the most horrific flight. From the time we left Brisbane until Dubai the washrooms were disgusting No hand tissue, no hand soap, the floor was littered with hand tissue and wet from urine and or water. The floor was sticky to walk on. As were were seated adjacent not far from the washrooms it was easy to observe the cabin crew very rarely checked the washrooms. There was an over use of the seat belt signs to ensure customers were seated rather than annoying the crew serving meals I was given the choice between beef and chicken and when I chose beef was informed there was none left but if I wanted to wait 20 minutes perhaps there maybe some left over. Sure enough 20 minutes later a beef meal arrived and was promptly dumped on the meal tray and was stone cold. The crew through the 15 hours were noticeably aggressive to all and sundry. The toilets were locked 20 minutes from landing in Dubai and my wife had to beg to use the washroom. Whilst we were informed this was the last flight out of Australia I guess the crew were coming to grips with loosing their jobs. Sorry but they still should have been professional until they finished their shifts. I have since written to Emirates feedback but no response. We hold return tickets to Australia and can only hope for a better experience.

When travelling by Emirates it is advisable to ensure that your luggage is secure and that you do not use back packs, duffel bags or any other type of bag whereby a zip can be seperated to allow baggage handlers access to your luggage.

"✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Cebu via Dubai. It was my first experience flying with Emirates and without the slightest doubt will be my last. I believe that critical situations bring out the true nature of people as well as companies and it is my opinion that Emirates came out as uncaring, irresponsible and thoroughly unethical. I had a return flight from the Netherlands to the Philippines and I was supposed to fly back from Cebu to Amsterdam at the end of March, but I became stranded due to the suddenly imposed lockdown. The situation became quickly truly dreary with flights getting cancelled by the hour and airports getting closed with almost no notice. The military being deployed in Manila and checkpoints set up to allow only tourists with a ticket for a flight leaving in the next 12 hours to enter. Tourists were informed to leave the country on 20th March at the latest. My domestic flight to Cebu was cancelled on 17th March and I desperately tried to contact Emirates to make the appropriate changes but to no avail: on their website, there was only a local telephone number to which nobody ever answered. I asked friends to contact the Emirates Dutch local office on my behalf, but they ended up with the same result, nobody answered the phone or Facebook messages. On 17th March a rescue flight was organized by a local private company, I landed in Clark International and went straight to the local Emirates office. The representative simply told me that they could not do anything for me because flights were fully booked, informed me that Clark airport would also be closed in 48 hours and told me that I had to figure out a solution myself. I had to purchase an incredibly expensive new flight with another airline departing that very same evening from Manila and rush against time to make it to the airport on time (I made it just thanks to the kindness of strangers who offered me a ride in a private transfer van). In the span of the following few hours i met at least a dozen travelers who had flights with KLM and who told me that KLM (not an airline partner) had rebooked all of them on Emirates flights. To summarize, Emirates made it impossible for stranded travelers to contact the airline, declined and shirked away from all responsibilities to find a solution, offered me no assistance and no compensation whatsoever, had no qualms to give away a large number of their seats to other (non-partner) airlines, but did not offer its own customers the same courtesy.

Not as good as some other cheaper airlines. Before there used to be 2 cabin crew pushing the trolley and serving the food, now it was only 1. Only 2 drinks service throughout the 6.5 hour flight, just 2. Rest of the time you have to ring the bell or go to the gallery to ask for drinks.

"Not Verified | London to Auckland via Dubai. I thought Emirates offered an extremely family-friendly service as I was travelling on my own with my 17-month-old son. They were extremely attentive throughout all of my flights. I thought the food was of a decent standard - they could have offered an extended drink service but if you wanted a second or a third drink you only had to ask. Some of the flights had a velcro cover for the bassinet which I did not like as my son could easily open it but the London to Dubai leg had a zip which made me feel at ease that he was safe. The flight attendants were happy to look after my son when I needed to go to the toilet and on a couple of flights, some of the attendants went the extra mile and carried my son around the plane to give me a break. They had bottled baby milk and organic baby food which was a first for me when flying with my children. On the way to New Zealand I flew to Lon-Dubai-Bali-Auckland and I preferred this to the return leg when I flew direct from Auckland to Dubai which was nearly 17 hours and I would not recommend it with a toddler. I thought the inflight entertainment was of a high standard but I could not connect to the Wifi on any of the flights. Some of the aircraft were a little tired and the seating could have done with replacing but overall I found Emirates offered a good service for a father taking his 17-month son all the way to New Zealand on his own.",1,2020-03-08,United Kingdom,False,verified london auckland via dubai thought emirate offered extremely family friendly service travelling month old son extremely attentive throughout flight thought food decent standard could offered extended drink service wanted second third drink ask flight velcro cover bassinet like son could easily open london dubai leg zip made feel ease safe flight attendant happy look son needed go toilet couple flight attendant went extra mile carried son around plane give break bottled baby milk organic baby food first flying child way new zealand flew lon dubai bali auckland preferred return leg flew direct auckland dubai nearly hour would recommend toddler thought inflight entertainment high standard could connect wifi flight aircraft little tired seating could done replacing overall found emirate offered good service father taking month son way new zealand
"✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Amsterdam via Dubai. While the previous flight with an Emirates A380 went OK, the connecting flight from Dubai to Amsterdam was terrible. In Dubai, the security check is at the gate, so it is not possible to bring a bottle of water with you. With this fact, Emirates does not bother to supply its passengers with an extra bottle of water during the flight but brings just one small cup of water at mealtimes. During the flight, the Emirates staff gathered at the rear pantry and were talking loud for a long time. Could not sleep with this irritating loud chatting. The toilets were not once cleaned during the 6.5-hour flight. Several toilets had a malfunction with water and some toilets had urine on the floor. Terrible! The seats were not very wide, narrow in fact, and had a hard seat. It was a claustrophobic experience. The seats have had their best years long ago. I have flown Emirates for many years and was always more or less satisfied, but the quality is going down the last two years and now at a level, I decided not to fly Emirates any more.",3,2020-03-07,Netherlands,True,singapore amsterdam via dubai previous flight emirate went ok connecting flight dubai amsterdam terrible dubai security check gate possible bring bottle water fact emirate bother supply passenger extra bottle water flight brings one small cup water mealtime flight emirate staff gathered rear pantry talking loud long time could sleep irritating loud chatting toilet cleaned hour flight several toilet malfunction water toilet urine floor terrible seat wide narrow fact hard seat claustrophobic experience seat best year long ago flown emirate many year always le satisfied quality going last two year level decided fly emirate

"✅ Trip Verified | London Stansted to Colombo via Dubai. First flight with Emirates after several years using other airlines and I must say standards have slipped. Emirates used to be a cut above, with better food, IFE and more generous alcohol supply. Now they are very run of the mill and when you add in the inconveniences of Dubai airport compared with other options in the gulf they are solidly average. I used them because Stansted is my local airport, so their flights are convenient and because of this will probably reluctantly use the company in future. Low point of my 4 economy flights was the unsmiling, unfriendly and arguably rude crew member I had looking after my part of the cabin on the outward leg from STN. Not once in 7 hrs did I see her make eye contact or smile at anyone, including her colleagues. The other crew I encountered were generally friendly and reasonably efficient. The seats felt worn and were not as comortable as I remember, probably as the aircraft are generally ageing across their fleet. The food ranged from edible to fairly horrible, only the IFE remains outstanding.

"Not Verified |  I've flown business class (as well as premium economy) many times on long-haul flights between Asia and the US, on a pretty wide variety of airlines. For my current trip, there appeared to be a reasonably good business class fare (but not the best fare among all airline selections) to NYC via Dubai on Emirates, apparently because of a long (7+ hour) layover in Dubai. Even though it wasn't the best business class fare available among all airlines, and the layover was longer than I'd prefer, I chose Emirates based on their reputation. However, Emirates doesn't inform you when purchasing the ticket, and you don't find out until you arrive at the airport in Dubai, that this business class fare does not include any lounge access. So, you basically get a slight discount on a business class fare, but no business class lounge access during a 7+ hour layover. Also, on the Emirates 777-300ER, the business class seat does not actually lay flat (its angled quite a bit), and the leg / foot section of the seat when extended is rather flimsy. Unless you have a child-size body, it's quite difficult to get comfortable for any actual sleep on a long haul ""business class"" flight with the type of seat that Emirates installed on the 777-300ER. Based on my actual flight and in-airport experiences, I'd rank business class on other airlines much higher than Emirates business class. For long haul travel between Asia and the US, I'd even rank Philippine Airlines business class in a higher category than Emirates, particular because Philippine Airlines business class fares are typically several to many hundreds of USD cheaper than Emirates best business class fares, and you aren't subjected to any undisclosed trickery relating to business class lounge access. I'll avoid Emirates in the future, for sure - Emirates is way overpriced for what you actually get. Come to think of it, for a route between Asia and NYC through the Mideast, I'd have to say premium economy on Qatar Airlines is a much better value for the money, with a reasonably good comfort level as well as excellent service, as compared to Emirates business class.",1,2020-02-16,Singapore,False,verified flown business class well premium economy many time long haul flight asia u pretty wide variety airline current trip appeared reasonably good business class fare best fare among airline selection nyc via dubai emirate apparently long hour layover dubai even though best business class fare available among airline layover longer prefer chose emirate based reputation however emirate inform purchasing ticket find arrive airport dubai business class fare include lounge access basically get slight discount business class fare business class lounge access hour layover also emirate er business class seat actually lay flat angled quite bit leg foot section seat extended rather flimsy unless child size body quite difficult get comfortable actual sleep long haul business class flight type seat emirate installed er based actual flight airport experience rank business class airline much higher emirate business class long haul travel asia u even rank philippine airline business class higher category emirate particular philippine airline business class fare typically several many hundred usd cheaper emirate best business class fare subjected undisclosed trickery relating business class lounge access avoid emirate future sure emirate way overpriced actually get come think route asia nyc mideast say premium economy qatar airline much better value money reasonably good comfort level well excellent service compared emirate business class

"✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Zurich via Dubai. After hearing nothing but great things about Emirates I have been left so disappointed. Our first leg from Brisbane to Dubai started with them not giving my 7 year old daughter her meal. Not only did they forget the first meal of the 14hr flight but I had to ask them again for the second meal. Approximately 4 hours out from Dubai the oxygen masks dropped from the panels above. After 15 long minutes we were advised that they thought it is a technical issue. Passengers were then asked to fold up the oxygen masks as best we could and they were left hanging in front of us. Following this there was no in-flight entertainment or service for the remainder of the flight. No compensation was offered and staff seemed more concerned about passengers who were recording the incident. After our horrendous flight and poor service from Brisbane, I asked at Heathrow about an upgrade and was told flights to Brisbane were fully booked. This was not true as the Dubai to Brisbane leg was half empty and many people had three seats to themselves. The check in procedure at Heathrow we had to use the self service machines and this was not made clear until we had already queued for 25 minutes. There were no toilets in the lounges at Heathrow and Dubai which meant that once you had shown your passport and ticket and gone into the lounge you had to go back outside to the toilets and then queue again. Our flight from London departed at 9pm. My daughter didn’t end up getting her meal until 11.50pm. It took them 2.5hrs to commence the meal service. The flight from Dubai to Brisbane was no better. My 7 year old needed to go to the toilet as soon as we got on the plane and the toilet hadn’t been cleaned. My 7 year old fell asleep on take off so I asked if her meal could be kept for later when she woke up. I was told this was not a problem however when I asked for it 7 hours later I was told we she couldn’t have as they couldn’t reheat it. I then had to ask if I could at least get the other food that didn’t require being reheated. The customer service on three of the four flights was absolutely appalling. The flight attendants were not pleasant and friendly.  On one flight I pressed the buzzer for some water due to my daughter being asleep on me and no-one attended at all – the plane landed 1.5 hours after I pressed the buzzer and we disembarked. I could not get over the amount of time the seat belt signs came on when there was barely any turbulence. On top of this, the excessive amount of time they kept the seatbelt sign on when there was no turbulence was ridiculous. At one point it had been on for over one hour and my daughter needed the toilet. We got up to go to the toilet and I was told I would be going at our own risk.  It felt to me that they kept the seat belt sign on for an extended period so the crew got out of doing work. I have travelled extensively for the past 20 years and Emirates is the worst airline I have ever flown with. Do not waste your money.

On the return journey the scones, clotted cream and jam was acceptable but the rest of the 6 meals we had on the other 3 flights were horrible. Emirates beef and mash - meat was too large and overcooked to be edible, sauce saltier than sea water and a salad of sweetcorn. Emirates directly employed staff are great but third party ground handling staff are horrible. No customer service skills at all shown in Mumbai. They didn’t even offer a buggy for my child in a massive airport and then went on to charge me an extortionate amount for 17kg excess baggage. No hospitality in Dubai, forget a lounge, no information communication or water when delayed with a family. Their profit grabbing has lead to a simple burger and fries meal costing £20 for 1 person and a sub standard lounge at £180 at my expense!

In a nutshell, my experience of the lounge and the flight was underwhelming. The Emirates Business Class lounge at Dubai airport, although huge, is dated and so big that it becomes inconvenient.  Huge, but so convenient to navigate so one has to keep walking, hoping to find anything. The food was average. The service was courteous. The flight was not even 3 hours but what really made it an unpleasant experience was the attitude of the air hostess serving my side. The welcome on board was anything but warm. I thought, maybe they are busy and it will get better. I am short and had a heavy backpack and a duty-free shopping bag in my hand. I was struggling to open the overhead bin but she did not offer to help me or open the bin for me. On the contrary, when I asked where to put it she just gestured and ignored that I was in a pickle. Thankfully, a fellow passenger got up to help me. The air hostess's attitude continued for the rest of the flight - once she was passing by and I stopped her for a glass of water and she almost did an eye roll when she stopped. I did not pay extra for this. Honestly, my experience with Emirates Economy when going to Dubai was better than this. The biggest turn off is a staff with an attitude. Fine, they probably do not like the Dubai to Pakistan sector but that is not my fault. We pay a good amount and honestly, it does not take much to be nice and courteous. So disappointed, especially when I thought Emirates business class would be the best experience. The 2-3-2 configuration is poor, the wifi never worked,.

"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a flight from Tehran to Auckland via Dubai in January 2020. Due to the Ukrainian flight crash, our flight was rescheduled twice by Emirates, which means we had to have 20.5 hr of stop in Dubai. We called the airline office in Tehran to see our options of accommodation in Dubai. They said yes due to a stop longer than 13 hrs the airline must provide accommodation for you but they didn’t have access to the hotel booking system and asked us to address this issue in emirates airline counter in Dubai airport. We arrived in Dubai and asked about the hotel booking option. Surprisingly they said we cannot have any accommodation provided by airline, and it is not their problem! We had arguments about the airline policy and they were refusing to show us the policy and just giving us some wrong information that it is in their policy and they cannot provide accommodation. After 2 hrs of discussion and argument, they finally provided a twin room for three people. We were really disappointed. I had a surgery on my neck about two weeks before the flight which and had to ask the cabin crew to open the head locker for me.

"Not Verified |  New York to Perth via Dubai. Our outbound was delayed from Newark and I was concerned on our entire flight that we would miss our connection in Dubai. The host assured me Emirates had the ability to hold any flight for up to one hour, and that we would make our connection. We arrived only to find we had missed our connection by 20 minutes. We were devastated, as this was the only flight out that day, and were told we would have to spend 24 hours in Dubai. There was no one on the ground to help us, so we made our own way to customer service. The staff were rude and completely unapologetic that we would lose 24hrs from our vacation. They told us to go to the hotel and didn't give us any guidance as to how to get our baggage, or even where our baggage would end up. The flight they rebooked us on allocated us seats at the back of the plane, as if losing 24hrs wasn't punishment enough. We then spent a further 3 hours at the airport, trying to get our seats moved and also secure our baggage. Even more concerning than all of this, there was no guidance around what it meant to enter the UAE and what we should be careful of medication-wise. When we went through customs to enter Dubai, they searched my bag and started questioning myself and my husband for sleep medication I had with me. It was incredibly disturbing and made even worse later finding out my husband had both Benedryl and pseudoephedrine - two over the counter drugs that are jailable offences in the UAE without a prescription! This is a complete lack of duty of care by Emirates.  This is disgusting behavior and not what I expect of what is said to be a premium airline.

One criticism – which was shared by other passengers and indeed cabin crew we spoke to – is the appalling choice of music played when boarding the aircraft. We heard a number of songs dating back to the 1970s and 1980s which we had hoped we would never hear again. Although boarding was efficient, exiting was more chaotic. The problem is that both business and economy passengers are converging on the same exit which meant that it took an inordinate amount of time get off the aircraft.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to New York via Dubai. For this trip to JFK we decided to travel 1st time with emirates. On the departure date the journey was more than 21 hours from Singapore. The staff in the plane were arrogant and unhelpful. They were unwilling to help even for taking hot water for my other baby to make milk. Imagine requesting for hot water for baby milk (1st time on to the flight) and was greeted with an unhappy face from the crew. This is not during the period where everyone were required to remain seated. We are family of 8. Our baby 24 mths old and 4 mths old were not making things easy. The staff was rude to us from the start.  We were not demanding passenger nor were we rude at any time. We had on many occasions called them by pressing the button but at all times nobody came to our seat to attend to us. This is far from what we called excellent service coming from an international airline.  They told us to put up the hand carry luggage ourselves when my 13 yr old daughter had difficulties on 1 occasion. On another occasion there were clean pair of socks on the floor and they told us to clean that up. I was appalled by the choice of words they used. They even make unhappy faces when we requested for drinks as kids were thirsty. I am not a big eater but even i find that the food provided was insufficient in portion. We should have been served a proper meal for the last meal but instead we were given a small piece of pizza. As we were all very hungry on that day and Halal food was difficult to find at JFK airport we had to travel very far to have our meal at Philadelphia, the only place we know there were authentic halal food.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Stansted to Singapore via Dubai. The flight was long and arduous due to flooding at Dubai airport. This was obviously out of Emirates control. However the lost my bag, and as I was travelling on official business I was forced to purchase a replacement suit and medication. I first rang the emirates number in Singapore and spoke to an individual who told me they would email about the case. No email arrived. A week later I was passing through the airport again and went to the Emirates desk. The member of staff was incredibly rude, and informed me it was nothing she could help with (in fact she just sat shaking her head for most of the conversation). I then rang the Singapore number again and the member of staff informed me I would have to complain. I explained that I did not want to complain, but was just looking to have a normal conversation with a member of staff. The cost of the replacement clothes was modest. Anyway, I then used the feedback form online to send my request, and received nothing back after 3 days. Emirates do not provide an email address. My next step was to speak with someone on online chat function, who informed me it could take up to 30 days to respond to my complaint. I expressed incredulity at this number. My only conclusion is that Emirates does not do customer service - unless that is, you want to buy a business class ticket. It has been a very frustrating and sorry affair. The lack of clear information, mixed messages, is very frustrating. Individual members of staff seem to have no authority to deal with a problem, which speaks to a dysfunctional and frustrating work environment.",1,2020-01-23,United Kingdom,True,stansted singapore via dubai flight long arduous due flooding dubai airport obviously emirate control however lost bag travelling official business forced purchase replacement suit medication first rang emirate number singapore spoke individual told would email case email arrived week later passing airport went emirate desk member staff incredibly rude informed nothing could help fact sat shaking head conversation rang singapore number member staff informed would complain explained want complain looking normal conversation member staff cost replacement clothes modest anyway used feedback form online send request received nothing back day emirate provide email address next step speak someone online chat function informed could take day respond complaint expressed incredulity number conclusion emirate customer service unless want buy business class ticket frustrating sorry affair lack clear information mixed message frustrating individual member staff seem authority deal problem speaks dysfunctional frustrating work environment

The unacceptable fact is that once the passengers got off the bus, soaking under the storm, the crew hindered the traffic, stopping the passengers outside the airplane access door to check their documents before allowing entry, despite having credited our access at the boarding gate and when boarding the bus. It is ridiculous that security measures are so poorly coordinated that they need to check the boarding passes three times. After twenty minutes under the rain, I managed to enter the plane.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to San Francisco via Dubai. I traveled to San Francisco  for important business meetings. After experiencing almost 4 hours of delays I was informed on my arrival (12 Jan. 2020) in SF, Emirates informed me that my baggage had been lost.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to London via Dubai. KL to DXB has no issue at all. Was a smooth aircraft n service. The meals and services were good. But the problem has started with flight EK001 while flying to London. I already booked a preference seat and also requested a special hindhu vegetarian meal choice. But without my consent, there was a couple sit in my seat and asking me to exchange the seat. I didn't made any argument just accepted without any sorry and thanks from them. Later on when the special meals (veggie/kids meals) were distributing I have told a cabin crew that I made a special request for meals and exchange my seat.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Manchester. I find that when you fly Emirates you tend to get one of two types of experience in the Business Class cabin. You are either totally blown away by the friendliness and the level of service or you are totally underwhelmed and thinking that you should have spent your money elsewhere. This flight was the latter of the two. The crew could not be less interested in the passengers. They spent most of their time on the flight in the galley say down chatting amongst themselves. The flight was a night flight and they said it was a reduced service flight! I explained that I was hungry so they gave me two tepid seafood dishes - revolting. The A380 was a 2 class model and quite frankly had seen better days and looked in need of a clean. Emirates need to lift their game if they want to keep up with the likes of Qatar, Cathay, Asiana or even Qantas or Air NZ.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Dubai in first class was not amazing it was nice. The service was adequate, the seat was comfortable, the entertainment was what you expect on Emirates, i.e. lots of it but not any films that I  was really excited about, but enough to keep you entertained. The only thing for me on the flight that was a stand out was the catering that was very good, as was the wine selection - which strangely enough was not top shelf wines but very good middle of the road wine. What was bizarre for me was the lack of training in the food and wine that the crew had. Did not know the wines and served the caviar with a metal spoon. I asked for a bone spoon and they said that they did not have any - and when I pointed out that metal reacts with the caviar and that is why it is not normally used, they looked at me if I was from the moon. Also bad practice was making First passengers pay for wifi. The flight was a code share with Qantas and the crew kept telling me wifi was free if I joined their FF programme. When I pointed out I was Qantas they said oh well you have to pay then. I think that that Qatar Airways QSuite business class is a better product than the EK first class, but that is just me.

"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Kolkata via Dubai. We were able to get adjacent seats in bulkhead, giving us a good bit of leg space and being at the edge in the centre section of a 3x4x3 layout, the flight to Dubai left us feeling less cramped. The plane was organized in a way that offered spaces to stand and stretch and the bathrooms on the flight to Dubai were tidy. We were served ample meals and liquor was provided on request. Snacks were laid out in the galley. The collection of films to view was huge -- in fact, selecting from this immense library was a challenge. Good head sets were provided. Flight attendants were friendly and I thought their uniforms were attractive. The wait at Dubai to connect to Calcutta was several hours but the airport is a shopper's paradise. I found the prices on liquor competitive and there were many international shops and eateries. The terminals were clean  with ample seating. The security check between flights was smooth. At JFK on boarding, a camera snapped our picture; the boarding passes themselves were not scanned. We had economy class tickets but on boarding at Dubai, we found a cabin crew member selling empty seats in business class. He had a mobile credit card reader. We paid for two tickets. The business class was in a 2x3x2 layout and was uncrowded.  The cabin felt old fashioned and the seats did not go to 180 degrees; it was angled, but comfortable nevertheless. Attendants were  very pleasant. Duty free shopping was available and I picked up a a few cosmetics. No landing cards were provided. Neither were any amenity kits, though a pair of socks and a eye shade in a plastic wrapper was in the magazine pocket. The TV screens were on the wall separating the biz class cabin from first class. All the flights were on schedule. Emirates does not belong to any of the big 3 alliances. The only US airline you can get points with is Jet Blue.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Trivandrum to New York via Dubai. I have been a regular customer on Emirates Airlines for the last 5 years and chose this airline over many others because of the great service in the past. However, in my most recent travels, I have experienced poor management of flight connections in Dubai Airport. Due to this, I have missed several flights to New York, have been stranded in Dubai for days, have lost or missed my baggage, or have had to run at top speed to barely make it to my gate on time. There is technically only a tight 1 hour and 15-minute layover in Dubai but lately, the flight from TRV to Dubai has been arriving 30-45 minutes late due to an inability to get a gate. This of course suggests poor planning and organizing on your airline’s behalf. This delay leaves about 20 minutes for us to deboard the plane, figure out our new gate, clear security (twice), and arrive at our departing flight. It is almost impossible to do this especially for customers who are first time travelers, older, disabled, or impaired. As an asthmatic, the marathon run I had to make from Terminal C to Terminal A led to bad wheezing and could have resulted in a medical emergency if I had not carried my inhaler. Several times, we only barely made our Dubai to JFK flight because we paid for preferred seats in the front of the plane allowing us to leave quickly. Despite experiencing this incredibly stressful connection, Emirates staff provides no support to help us off the flight quickly. In fact, on our December 12th flight when we alerted the flight attended about our very tight connection (EK201 was already boarding when we landed), she dismissively told us “everyone has a connection flight not just you”. She also argued with my father and I for 5 minutes further delaying our exit from the plane. This is poor management and could be remedied by announcing the names of passengers with very tight connections. However, it seems Emirates no longer cares about their customers. Due to our marathon run, we did make our flight on December 12th, but my relief was short-lived. We were informed that all 3 of our checked bags were not loaded and would instead arrive on EK203 on December 13th at 8:00 am. On December 13th, I called the Emirates number for baggage services at 9am and was told my bags had arrived and JFK and needed to clear customs before it was delivered to my home. I was also informed that I would be updated on my baggage status- which did not occur. My family and I were put through hell to get our baggage back. We had to contact Emirates 5-7 times within the day. At one point, a chat service agent gave us conflicting information insisting that our baggage was still in Dubai despite being told otherwise many times. Ultimately after and exhausting flight and while still jetlagged we had to stay up until 2:30 am calling both Emirates and the delivery company (Bex) every hour till our bags were delivered. Due to the issues detailed above, my family and I have decided to no longer fly Emirates. . I used to be a loyal customer, but your company has really gone down the drain these past few flights and loyalty is not a good enough reason to suffer during my travels. Horrible Service.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I've been travelling Emirates for over a decade for work, am a Skywards customer, and have previously always been impressed with the quality of the services on board. However, in the last few years I've seen a decline in the food quality and lounge facilities, as access has grown dramatically. All this is fine, except for a recent incident which has convinced me it's time to switch to another airline for our long haul flights. This past year I was denied boarding on a Dubai-Kolkata leg of a flight while I was enroute to a wedding.  I requested not to be the ""random"" selection for denied boarding (due to overbooking). I was told as compensation I would be given a return ticket from Dubai to Calcutta, but I explained this had no value to me as someone who lives in Canada and is not based in Dubai. The Agent then  informed me that he had made a note on the file and upon ticketing it could be changed to a ticket from Dubai-Toronto upon calling in. I confirmed verbally with the agent 3 times. It was 2 am, and I retreated to get some sleep. Naturally when I went to use the ticket, I was informed this was not possible. However the Emirates ticketing agents informed me that the ticket could be used to fly from Dubai to Middle East destinations such as Syria, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan and then chuckled. I have spent multiple hours on the phone with Emirates agents trying to sort out the problem, and the service has ranged from excellent and understanding (thank you Connor in Manchester), to rude and gleeful at pulling a bit of a hoax on a customer. Ultimately Emirates refused to honour the guarantees made by the agent (in spite of conducting an investigation which did not result in findings that contradicted my statements), because their agent was a DNATA representative. In short, you cannot trust the folks standing under the Emirates sign at the check-in in Dubai, because Emirates itself will not back their guarantees.

"✅ Trip Verified |  EK 318 from Dubai to Tokyo, Narita on 21st Nov 2019. This flight seemed to have issues right from the start. The Boarding gate where we were to board had several leaks so we had to try and huddle in the dry sections. There was not enough seating. Boarding was chaotic at best and anyone willing to lie about their Emirates membership got in first. The lady at the door was unable to cope. The cabin was dirty, the crew seemed to not know each other, 2 rows at the back in Economy were kept empty for the use of crew (at the cost of paying passengers and despite having a section for crew to rest and sleep) which despite my request they refused to relinquish. Rest of the passengers had to make do without the 6 extra seats. Apparently this is a regular reservation for the crew on this flight. I paid 350 Dirhams for a horrible seat with legroom only for my right leg. Photo attached. Crew shouted to each other about running out of meals, one crew member scolded the other members and paid very little attention to the general public. There was one apparently senior staff who did a royal walk through the cabin and only spoke to 3 or 4 people whom she chose, I am guessing at random. Lastly they took away blankets an hour before landing and then piled them into bags. So again customer was last. It was cold and we were still an hour away.

Not Verified |  Very disappointed with this airline. The service is very poor and some cabin crew can appear disinterested. I previously used Ethiopian Airlines which has excellent service levels and was expecting similar service and better from Emirates and was sorely disappointed. The fleet used in intra-Africa flights (between Lusaka and Dubai in my case) have tiny seats and I was squashed and worried for my safety as I was in a row of three with a very large guy in the middle and I couldn't rest comfortably and was worried about getting injured. I'm used to old fleets used for intra-africa flights but Emirate seats are the smallest I've experienced. It was the worst flight ever. The cabin crew can miss rows when serving meals or drinks and it's just an annoying service. Although my flight from Dubai to London was on a new fleet with comfortable chairs what didn't change was cabin crew service which was still poor. The food is also average. I expected so much and had high hopes and was very disappointed. All style with no substance.

"✅ Trip Verified | Glasgow to Dubai. My husband and I use Emirates twice a year to fly to Dubai because it’s direct with good times and have done for many years. Sadly we have found that the last few trips the service is lacking. Yes you are greeted on arrival but that is as far as the service goes. From getting a hot towel and nuts before take off to getting a menu and scowl. On this return trip after the meal was served the drinks trolley was coming up the aisle, then the stewardess stopped three rows ahead of us and wheeled past and never returned. I do feel that rather than standing gossiping with each other in the galley the stewards/stewardesses should be going round their section making sure their passengers are ok and not waiting to be summoned. The food is really not as good now either. Always curry, which is fine now and again but not all the time. The coffee is weak and horrible too. Lots of corners being cut but prices going up. Also the rewards scheme is a joke as we will never have enough to save to make proper use of them.

They called me after 3 days and asked for the receipt of the bag. I emailed them the receipt promptly the same day. Then Emirates staff said, Emirates will process my request and will contact me after a few days. Then after a couple of weeks, they contacted and asked to get back the damaged bag in order to send me the compensation. I was away from Kolkata and told them that I am away from Kolkata and it will be tough for me to go to Kolkata airport to give the bag, what if they collect it from me after I go back to the USA. They said okay. After coming back I contacted Emirates via phone and the customer service responded with the utmost courtesy and apologized every time for the delay and promised that someone will get back to me within 24 hours.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Athens. This has been my worst flying experience.  I received an email to check into my flight from Newark to Athens, which I did hours before my flight. Due to a glitch in the system, the app failed to provide me with a digital boarding pass but confirmed that I was checked in. I figured that I would print my boarding pass when I got to the airport so I didn’t worry too much about it. Upon reaching the airport I go to the clerk to print my boarding pass and she tells me that I am not checked in. I show her the confirmation in my phone from their app confirming that I am checked in and for whatever reason she cannot seem to find me in their system. So I ask her where's the kiosk so that I can quickly check myself and come to find out, Newark airport has no Emirates kiosk and the lines are flooded with passengers? I tried my hardest to inform the Emirates representative at the desk that I was indeed checked in but she informs me that because she doesn’t see me in their system I cannot board the plane. So I pleaded with the woman to tell me what I needed to do to get checked in and she told me that the only way to check in is to do it through their app. I asked if I could speak to a manager or call Emirates, and the rep tells me that there is no time because the plane is about to take off. So even though I arrived in time for my flight, I was now late for my flight, and I was unable to board. I call Emirates and I was informed that I would have to purchase new tickets  or just pay a no show fee which is $400 per person plus additional fees. Which came out to $850 per person. Which actually added up to just purchasing new tickets. The thing is I not only had more than one hotel booked but I also had a connecting flight that I would also inevitably miss a well as other arrangements so I lost time, money, and had to spend more money to purchase two new tickets, also two more plane tickets when i reached Athens to finish my travel. At this point I'm infuriated and disgusted because I do not live by Newark airport, I live 1hr and 20 mins away, so not only did I miss my flights including a whole nights stay at some of my hotels, and my flight from Athens, I was stranded at this airport.",1,2019-11-05,United States,True,newark athens worst flying experience received email check flight newark athens hour flight due glitch system app failed provide digital boarding pas confirmed checked figured would print boarding pas got airport worry much upon reaching airport go clerk print boarding pas tell checked show confirmation phone app confirming checked whatever reason cannot seem find system ask kiosk quickly check come find newark airport emirate kiosk line flooded passenger tried hardest inform emirate representative desk indeed checked informs see system cannot board plane pleaded woman tell needed get checked told way check app asked could speak manager call emirate rep tell time plane take even though arrived time flight late flight unable board call emirate informed would purchase new ticket pay show fee per person plus additional fee came per person actually added purchasing new ticket thing one hotel booked also connecting flight would also inevitably miss well arrangement lost time money spend money purchase two new ticket also two plane ticket reached athens finish travel point infuriated disgusted live newark airport live hr min away miss flight including whole night stay hotel flight athens stranded airport
"✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to Rome via Dubai. The services on the flight were beyond disappointing. I was recommended Emirates by friends and colleagues, as the best business class from Sydney to Europe. I was beyond disappointed when returning. Having flown to Europe business class for work and leisure with Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Etihad, and having flown business class to other locations on Hawaiian and Latam, I was very surprised to be so dissatisfied with the service and quality I received from Emirates, having been recommended by many colleagues and friends. I was disappointed to discover that the 14-hour flight from Dubai to Sydney did not have a lie flat bed (nor did Rome to Dubai, however, this was only 5 hours). More importantly, the service was appalling. My salad was rotting (attached photo) and my entrée was still frozen (attached photo). My TV repeatedly broke down during the flight (attached photo). The flight was largely full, so we could not be moved to another two seats seated close to one another. After raising this and the other issues with the crew, she became quite rude. Beyond our experience on the flight, upon boarding the flight at Dubai we were delayed as a result of the poor organisation at the airport for the duty-free items we had purchased in Rome. We had to provide these to be boxed and sealed, which was not the issue. The person who was doing this task, kept our boarding passes for the purposes of printing the tags to put on the boxes. However, we saw people who arrived after us, receive their boarding passes and board the flight before us, notwithstanding repeatedly asking for the gentleman to return our boarding passes to us so that we could board. Eventually, we were able to board, but only after first and business class had boarded and about half of the economy cabin. Finally, we did not receive any form of confirmation regarding our chauffeur from Sydney Airport to our home address, adding further to our stress as we were required to chase this to make sure it had been arranged. Having flown business class with various carriers, I was not impressed at all by the return flight to Sydney on Emirates in comparison. Business is not just about extra space, but about the extra service. The extra space was far from what is equivalently offered by other airlines, given the absence of a lie flatbed. Adding to that the poor service, I did not receive the benefits expected of business class, but instead economy. Since then, I have tried to liaise with Emirates to resolve the issue. After an offer of points which wouldn't even be enough for a single short-haul domestic flight, they informed me that they had made their 'final offer' and closed off correspondence. I would strongly recommend flying anything other than Emirates. Their service is terrible, before, during and after the flight and falls short of what is comparably offered.",4,2019-11-05,Australia,True,sydney rome via dubai service flight beyond disappointing recommended emirate friend colleague best business class sydney europe beyond disappointed returning flown europe business class work leisure singapore airline qantas etihad flown business class location hawaiian latam surprised dissatisfied service quality received emirate recommended many colleague friend disappointed discover hour flight dubai sydney lie flat bed rome dubai however hour importantly service appalling salad rotting attached photo entr e still frozen attached photo tv repeatedly broke flight attached photo flight largely full could moved another two seat seated close one another raising issue crew became quite rude beyond experience flight upon boarding flight dubai delayed result poor organisation airport duty free item purchased rome provide boxed sealed issue person task kept boarding pass purpose printing tag put box however saw people arrived u receive boarding pass board flight u notwithstanding repeatedly asking gentleman return boarding pass u could board eventually able board first business class boarded half economy cabin finally receive form confirmation regarding chauffeur sydney airport home address adding stress required chase make sure arranged flown business class various carrier impressed return flight sydney emirate comparison business extra space extra service extra space far equivalently offered airline given absence lie flatbed adding poor service receive benefit expected business class instead economy since tried liaise emirate resolve issue offer point even enough single short haul domestic flight informed made final offer closed correspondence would strongly recommend flying anything emirate service terrible flight fall short comparably offered

"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Amsterdam via Dubai. Disappointed with the experience in general. I have flown with Emirates since the last 15 years & was easy to see how the service has gone downhill. The cabin crew (with an exception of a few) didn't seem interested in their job, no sign of any courtesy what so ever. I felt as if they are doing us a favour letting us fly on their airline, sorry but we paid for our seats, it wasn't a free ride.  On a specific incident, during food service from Dubai to Amsterdam, noticed that the cabin crew ran out of lunch options from the two sets ahead of me, which is understandable. However the cabin crew still kept asking the following passengers including myself what would we like to have only to bluntly respond back that they have run out of options. Just couldn’t understand why was she asking what we passengers would like to have when she did not have any option in the first place? This was repeated over and over again finally asking the two passengers next to me. When I questioned her about this, she had no answer, soon after I could clearly see her behaviour towards me was immediately inhospitable, she even walked passed me without asking if I needed to have a tea or coffee. I didn’t care about the tea or coffee, but guess what it did leave me with a bad taste for the airline, besides I do get to have the last say by inputting a poor score on the infotainment screen at the end of the flight, which I did. Cabin crew of airlines thank or greet their passengers while disembarking, however noticed that some of the cabin crew in Emirates didn’t seem to bother. On a positive note, the ground staff are great & at least courteous, something that is missing once you get on flight.

"✅ Trip Verified | Frankfurt to Singapore via Dubai. Avoid this airline at all cost. I was at Frankfurt airport trying to catch my flight to Singapore. At the gate, the ground staff were threatening to pull me off the flight if I don't comply with their 7-kg cabin luggage limit. I am totally fine with this as it has been enforced by many airlines. However, I have never come across such rude and hostile ground staff who have nothing to say but threats. They tried to play police and treat their customers like criminals. Customer service is simply non-existent. They rushed me to clear my bag or they were going to take me off the flight. Their hostile words were uncalled for and they kept telling me the gate was going to close, as if they were so hard-up on my money since every extra kg is 39 euro. I didn't want to argue with them as I know it was not the resolution. In the end, I paid over 100 euro as I wouldn't want to speak any further with them, and just wanted to get home.

"Not Verified | Had a disastrous experience with Emirates recently. I was supposed to fly from New Dehli to Dubai on a direct flight taking off at 9:50 pm. When we just arrived at the airport with my colleague we learned already that the flight would be delayed and ETA planned at 00:00. Just 15 min before the planned new departure, still no news. I had to go and try to get some info to be informed by chance that the flight has to land in Lucknow - 40 min away from Dehli for weather conditions. But a few more minutes to refuel and the flight would bridge at Dehli. Planned new departure: 1:40am. We then learned around 1:20 am that the flight would be delayed until 7:30 PM.with no further explanations. The whole crowd started to get mad, complaining vocally to the staff who had no explanation to give. I learned by chance again afterwards that the flying staff was on too many extra hours and had to rest before re-flying. Emirates did not anticipate this obvious issue that made the flight to Dubai impossible for a long time. After more than 1 hour of complaining and shouting, and no answers from the staff, a passenger took the lead and had to inform everyone that anyway our only solution would be to collect back our luggage and try to find an alternative flight if any. I decided to call Emirates who booked me on the 11 am flight as the 4:14 am flights with all the mess around would not be catchable for any of us despite the fact that 26 seats were still available due to the boarding pass issue. It took us another hour to go through the passport control back in a chaotic situation and finally get our luggage back. Emirates claimed that they would offer us a hotel and breakfast. But getting out of the airport we discovered that the 360 passengers we waiting on a parking lot for buses to come to drive us 40 min away from the airport. It would take 2 hours to get our room and it was already 4:30 am. We decided to avoid the mess and stay at the airport with no sleep and not even a single bottle of water given by Emirates. At 7 am when we checked in again and complained about our dreadful experience, the staff claimed that it was well managed, Emirates offering us a hotel room and a breakfast. It drove me mad and I asked to talk to the most Senior Emirates staff member at the airport. I could not talk to him as he was busy in a meeting, not even considering the fair complaint of an angry customer. He just did not care! I am flying 100 days a year for the last 15 years and it is the most painful experience I had so far.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Birmingham to Delhi via Dubai. The quality of Emirates has plummeted. From poor movie and entertainment choices, to screens not working, it was disappointing. The chair directly in front of me had a broken mechanism so it kept lurching backwards throughout the flight - even during take off. What is by far the worst for me (and has been discussed by friends who have recently flown economy Emirates) is the lack of drinks. They seem to have removed the bar service, except the limited drinks served with meals. So, I calculated we spent 5 hours without drink when you calculate our 2 hour stop over (where we were battling previous delay so no time got airport drinks), to be sitting in an aircraft got almost 2 hours before drinks became available. It was uncomfortable and poor service. Eventually I went to find the drinks myself - and was offered the standard small sealed cup! Shocking to think such inconsiderate service is part of Emirates - made more irritating by the signs on the screen asking passengers to keep hydrated during flights by drinking water. One very poor hot meal and the first and most awful 2 finger sandwich offered on a 7.6 hour flight - awful. And the WiFi was non existent - another reason we normally book with Emirates.

For such a long flight - it’s disappointing to not serve water at regular intervals - but it’s still the good part until now. Later at Dubai airport the staff were just bullies. Everyone was just asked to move from one place to other without much organisation and not respectfully but as cattleherd. There was a visually challenged man who was not shown any help or sympathy either.

This time as Jet Airways is no more, we were left with no choice than travel Emirates. Ours was a return journey and I wished the experience would never want us to look back for any other choice. But to our surprise, it turned vice-versa! To start with as soon as the flight started, the staff behaved like trainees. They didn't know where to start. We had a infant with us and it felt too cold.

So the cabin staff were hardly busy. After take off I did not see any uniformed flight attendants again, just a women in the serving ‘uniform’ who took food and drinks orders and served meals.

Knowing that it only consisted of 2 ingredients I wasn’t deterred as she might’ve thought I’d be. The meal courses were roughly put down and she went through the motions of begrudgingly serving me.

"Not Verified |  I was traveling with my family - wife and 5 year old from Newark to Dubai. One of the seats allocated to us was broken with the recliner button missing and being concealed with duct tape! When I highlighted this to the crew supervisor I was told that this seat should have been blocked and not allocated to any passenger. Since the flight was full and with only 1 middle row seat available, neither my wife nor I was comfortable to move leaving either me or my wife to tend alone to my toddler. Hence I decided to stay in the same seat.

"Not Verified |  Newcastle to Dubai. Having taken this flight for almost 4 years now, I have to display my displeasure over this most recent journey. Despite the flight leaving UK around lunchtime, the crew took the decision to turn down all the lights as soon as possible to pretend this was a night-time journey. What made the whole trip even more unbelievable, was the same exact thing occurred on the return journey even though departure from Dubai was 7:30am. I appreciate that Emirates used to pride themselves upon the free bar service for many years now, but to try and either save money by hoping people won't bother the flight staff if the plane is in darkness or the crews just decided to try for a quiet flight for themselves I don't really know. Being an elderly traveler (going to visit my son) I felt very uncomfortable trying to navigate my way to the bathrooms with very limited lighting. Passenger comfort and safety should always come before crew's desire for a quiet trip surely? Gone are the days where the crew would be traversing the plane regularly with drinks before, during and after the meal. I used to enjoy the spectacle, not that I took any alcohol anytime, it just seemed to break the journey down and make time pass faster. My son has submitted a complaint on Emirates website for me and has been sent only the standard ""We are looking into this"" email after almost 2 months now, so I assume they are not really interested in my comments - again, being a regular traveler on this route.",2,2019-08-29,United Kingdom,False,verified newcastle dubai taken flight almost year display displeasure recent journey despite flight leaving uk around lunchtime crew took decision turn light soon possible pretend night time journey made whole trip even unbelievable exact thing occurred return journey even though departure dubai appreciate emirate used pride upon free bar service many year try either save money hoping people bother flight staff plane darkness crew decided try quiet flight really know elderly traveler going visit son felt uncomfortable trying navigate way bathroom limited lighting passenger comfort safety always come crew desire quiet trip surely gone day crew would traversing plane regularly drink meal used enjoy spectacle took alcohol anytime seemed break journey make time pas faster son submitted complaint emirate website sent standard looking email almost month assume really interested comment regular traveler route

"✅ Trip Verified | BKK/HKG/BKK - In ten years of flying with Emirates business class on the short Bangkok to Hong Kong route I have rarely had anything other than an excellent flight. I just love the A380 aircraft and Emirates business class layout with the bar at the back. The decor is a bit plastic for my taste, but I take the airline for its unbeatable fares, its fantastic lounges with a quite amazing food and beverage selection, its on board service, the supreme comfort of the seating, the massive IFE selection and large screens. With first class dropped from this flight, the front of the upper deck now seats around 100 economy passengers. Yet the FA's usually make sure that these passengers remain seated whilst business class passengers can exit first. Given the economies that all airlines are now making, fast track cards are no longer handed out (not a problem for me as I have automatic fast entry at both airports), the main selection of the meal course is reduced to two offerings and the snacks in the bar are not as tasty as they used to be. But that is all rather irrelevant given all the pluses. On the outward sector I was too busy working to dine or use the IFE. I made do with a glass of the superb Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc and a sandwich from the bar. Having eaten well in the lounge, I also declined the meal on the return flight but did enjoy this time a fine Pinot Noir and another chunky chicken sandwich. On this sector I watched a movie and still had time for some classical music before we landed ahead of schedule. For a few months, Emirates replaced the A380 with a 777 on this route.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Christchurch to Sydney. Certainly not much positive to say about this airline other than the check in team were nice and efficient. All down hill from there, as we were delayed for take-off due to an ill passanger as soon as we had pushed back. No issue with illness, the problem was in Business no service was given to me even when after an hour I finally caught an attendant's eye for another drink and was abruptly told they were preparing for take-off again even though they were waiting on every whim of some other business guests. I'd paid for ""flexi business"" so not a cheap flight, yet the decor in the A380 is not to my taste of immitation golds, printed wood effect panelling with odd blue/grey seat shells, not relaxing or a calming vibe. Seats were otherwise comfortable, IFE remote is terrible for user functionality, and tray-table traps you in the seat so no mid-meal toilet trips. Crew were just a cog in the machine as they weren't personable and seemed distant to interact with everytime. My meal was quite tasty, another issue here was ordering Pinot Noir wasn't possible even simply asking for a red wine, still a blank stare so I gave up after multiple attempts as said pour whatever and ended up an musky white wine I couldn't drink. The attendands all understood English well, so it surprised me that it was so difficult to request a wine and even point at it on the menu! I was delayed and put up in a hotel for the night, however the shuttle driver only knew of one hotel to take us to and unfortunately only some of us were booked there. That hotel now full and multiple calls to Emirates, I was then told I was booked in a average hotel half-hour away even though I was the only Business guest and make my own way to the correct hotel. There weren't any Emirates members at the airport on the ground as many guests went around looking (myself included), so the only contact was once off the aircraft on the bridge an Emirates member told you which shuttle stop and a generic hotel name.

"✅ Trip Verified |  My first sector was from Madrid to Dubai. The purser on this flight was the crown jewel of the Emirates hospitality I remembered from my past travels. However she was assigned to business class whilst I was served by one crew who made my Emirates journey an utter disaster. The food on this flight was spectacular. The beef lasagna was great. The entertainment was limited compared to the newer A380s however it did have brilliant things that kept me entertained for 7 hours. Before take off I noticed that a customer who complained of a leaking AC was just shut down by a crew member who said 'cover your head for now, it'll stop after take off'. What a displeasing attitude from an airline renowned to be one of the best in the world.  At the meal service I noticed that meals run out when it comes to the seats at the back. The menu on that flight consisted of a chicken and beef option only, even though traditionally airlines of that calibre opt to offer a vegetarian option too. They had run out of the chicken option and my friend who for religious reasons does not consume beef, was forced with the beef option saying that was all they had. Whilst they refused to eat it, the crew who were called many times didn't even make a single appearance to enquire. Finally when it came to the pre arrival snack, they offered a chicken option and cheese option. The crew member just served the food without asking what I wanted. When I opened I realised I was given the tasteless cheese option. However, the passengers behind us were offered both where they had a choice.  My next flight was from Dubai to Colombo.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Colombo to Zurich via Dubai. The last time I flew Emirates I was quite young and overly obsessed by the greatness of its product and inflight service. However, Emirates has decided to put the past behind and embark on a poorly schemed, appalling venture of cost cutting at the cost of passenger comfort whilst still charging passengers exorbitantly. The first sector was from Colombo to Dubai. It was quite acceptable that Emirates never focused on its Asian sectors for they have extreme confidence that it's competitive pricing and brand name would get them customers inevitably. Therefore, I boarded this old 777-300, the inflight entertainment was certainly not much of a great deal on the first sector with quite limited options and by trying to handle it's terribly dysfunctional remote and put it back into its position, the wire had cut my finger. It gave me the worst airplane food ever. The crew on this sector thought were the only appealing segments of what I would call the emisery. They were attentive and kind and maintained a smile but however did not go the extra mile like the qatar airways cabin crew who were an extreme delight. Furthermore, another factor that put me off completely was how narrow and uncomfortable seats were. It was a completely disastrous 4 hours and 10 minutes. The next sector was from Dubai to Zurich with a layover of about 2 hours and 30 minutes. The layover was quite bad with basically no one willing to help us in the airport.  we boarded a brilliant A380 that was the only thing as good as they advertise. Once again a repetitive episode of rude crew and even worse food.

We have traveled extensively with other airlines like Etihad, BA, and Lufthansa. But this time, unfortunately, we decided to buy a nightmare by paying way more than other good airlines. It all started with check-in baggage. The check-in counter crew demanded our passports without greeting or smile. In the past, some stuff was stolen from my bags so I asked them to put the zip ties on the locks. After I insisted she threw some plastic zip ties at me and asked to put them on the locks with a red face. They flew one of the filthiest A380 on the planet. The plane looked pretty old with dirty bathrooms and broken seats. I requested the Hindu meal for my family (three of us) and the steward only got two of the meals. I asked him politely about my meals and his response was ""I only got two hands"". Later he came back and said he accidentally gave it to someone else and I have to eat whatever they have left. I later talked to the head of the crew about the incident and she apologized and promised me that she will take care of the next meal. Nothing happened except now ""The steward"" giving us angry looks every time he passes by.

"✅ Trip Verified | We flew with Emirates from Edinburgh to Singapore via Dubai. The segment between Edinburgh and Singapore was on a much older B777 wide-body plane. The seats do not lie 180 flat but at an angle. That is my main issue with the flight. The seat was so uncomfortable that I didn't get any sleep. The food was ok. The flight attendant was ok but lacking warmth. For instance, when I boarded the flight I handed over my jacket asking politely ""would you mind hanging this up for me"" to one of the flight attendants but was replied rather coldly that she would come back to me later. I understand that boarding is one of the busiest times for them but she was just not that friendly when she responded as if I was making an outrageous demand. However, the service in the second segment was better.

"❎ Not Verified | Bangkok to Istanbul via Dubai. I never liked Emirates, but due to last minute booking, Emirates was only available. All my fears came true. BKK - DXB: It was an overnight flight, so not much service required. Still, my monitor did not work, instead of rebooting it, I was offered to relocate myself. I did not want to do this; nothing happened with my monitor in 6.45 hours. Not a big issue, but shows the interest of the crew in real customer service. The crew was the most unpassionate and unpolite I saw in the last year. I look out for details and me even the uniforms were worn without proud and just looked untidy. It seemed like they were just angry and unhappy with their employer and shortsighted they make their passenger pay it. DXB lounge: just not up to a standard for a 3,000 USD ticket. Food average, furniture is worn out, staff unfriendly. DXB - IST: at last, the crew was friendly, and this was a good flight experience. Overall for Emirates became a luxury low-cost carrier, with overpricing in the high-end market.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuwait to Amman via Dubai on 3rd July 2019. If you ever depart from Kuwait and are flying Emirates, I’d strongly suggest using online check-in. At KWI, Emirates has a separate counter for online check-in passengers thus enabling passengers to skip the queue and proceed directly to the counter without having to wait. Be aware that during online check-in, you will not receive e-boarding passes if departing from Kuwait. I contacted Emirates and was told this is not an issue. At the counter, I received the boarding passes for both flights EK 856 (KWI-DXB) and my connecting flight EK 903 (DXB-AMM). The check-in experience was smooth, and within 10 minutes, I was through to immigration and security. Online check-in if departing from Kuwait is a lifesaver! First leg EK 856 from Kuwait to Dubai on the B777-300 ER. Boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. It was chaotic as expected for a fully-booked flight. Unfortunately, the aircraft was really old (registration A6-EBE). The screen was very small and ICE version was also very old. 3-4-3 configuration is not a favorite, and the seats felt narrow. Only 1 meal choice and no menus were given. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Kuwait due to late completion of boarding. Luckily, arrival in Dubai was only 5 minutes late despite the 30 minute delay departing Kuwait. If possible, book a seat on the left or right side of the aircraft (rows A, B, C or H, J, K). These seats will feel less cramped than seats in the middle (rows D, E, F, G). I was seated in seat 33A. Overall, a good flight although I’d avoid the EK B777 economy product all-together (unfortunately EK doesn’t fly the A380 to Kuwait so that’s not possible). Second leg EK 903 from Dubai to Amman on the A380-800. First time flying the EK A380! Again, boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. The aircraft was definitely newer (registration A6-EOU). ICE version was newer and screen was much bigger. Still a 3-4-3 configuration however much more comfortable than the 777. Just like the previous flight, no menus were given and there was only 1 meal choice. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Dubai and arrival in Amman was only 3 minutes late. I was seated in seat 78K. Baggage claim at AMM was abysmal! I wonder if the problem lies with Emirates or the baggage handling system at AMM. I can’t really give them much blame due to the fact that the aircraft was an A380, but waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes for baggage delivery is still unacceptable! Also, in my opinion, Emirates should really rethink boarding times. Boarding an aircraft 45 minutes prior to scheduled departure time surely guarantees a delay. On EK 856, pushback was not until 15 minutes after scheduled departure time and on EK 903, pushback was not until 13 minutes after scheduled departure time! In my opinion, boarding should begin 60 minutes prior to scheduled departure time. Also, Emirates should grant its aircraft a 2-hour turn-around time slot. This would give 1 hour to clean and prep the aircraft for boarding and an additional hour to complete boarding, ensuring an on-time departure.",1,2019-07-08,Kuwait,True,kuwait amman via dubai rd july ever depart kuwait flying emirate strongly suggest using online check kwi emirate separate counter online check passenger thus enabling passenger skip queue proceed directly counter without wait aware online check receive e boarding pass departing kuwait contacted emirate told issue counter received boarding pass flight ek kwi dxb connecting flight ek dxb amm check experience smooth within minute immigration security online check departing kuwait lifesaver first leg ek kuwait dubai b er boarding began minute prior departure chaotic expected fully booked flight unfortunately aircraft really old registration ebe screen small ice version also old configuration favorite seat felt narrow meal choice menu given aircraft minute late departing kuwait due late completion boarding luckily arrival dubai minute late despite minute delay departing kuwait possible book seat left right side aircraft row b c h j k seat feel le cramped seat middle row e f g seated seat overall good flight although avoid ek b economy product together unfortunately ek fly kuwait possible second leg ek dubai amman first time flying ek boarding began minute prior departure aircraft definitely newer registration eou ice version newer screen much bigger still configuration however much comfortable like previous flight menu given meal choice aircraft minute late departing dubai arrival amman minute late seated seat k baggage claim amm abysmal wonder problem lie emirate baggage handling system amm really give much blame due fact aircraft waiting hour minute baggage delivery still unacceptable also opinion emirate really rethink boarding time boarding aircraft minute prior scheduled departure time surely guarantee delay ek pushback minute scheduled departure time ek pushback minute scheduled departure time opinion boarding begin minute prior scheduled departure time also emirate grant aircraft hour turn around time slot would give hour clean prep aircraft boarding additional hour complete boarding ensuring time departure
"Not Verified |  I was travelling from  Gatwick to Kochi via Dubai and had a small carry on bag and my back pack. I was allowed 7 Kgs and my bag weighed a little over 7 Kgs. I did not have any problem at  Gatwick Airport. I had a connecting flight from Dubai to Kochi. As  Dubai airport duty free had some excellent deals and I ended up buying a couple of bottles of liquor and some chocolates. At the boarding gate, the customer service personnel forced me to weigh my carry on bags again and found 4 Kgs extra due to the items that I bought from the airport and asked me to pay for over weight. I was given 3 options: 1. Throw away the items that I bought from the airport (worth USD$200) 2. Return the items back to the store that was 20 minutes away from the gate 3. Pay for the excess baggage $100 I was put in a very tough situation when I was so tired from my previous two flights (8 hours each). I did not have any other choice than paying for the excess baggage. My advise to anyone travelling through Dubai, is to avoid buying any thing from the duty free if you already have 7 Kgs of items in your carry on baggage. They are going to weigh it at the boarding gate and charge you a huge amount that would kill all the savings that you got from your purchases.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Manchester. The worst cabin service I have experienced on any airline. At great expense I took the flight from Dubai to Manchester yesterday, excited to be trying a business class seat on the A380. I fly often but I have to say this was the worst cabin crew I have ever experienced on any airline. I feel as if I paid for them to have a great holiday. I know that other passengers felt the same way. We were all SO upset that we talked to each other about it both on the plane and afterwards. From the moment of boarding, there was no usual warm welcome. I was greeted by a very grumpy hostile cabin attendant. When she brought the breakfast menu later she couldn’t answer simple questions about the ingredients. “I can’t say”. “Could you please find out?” “No, the meal is precooked, we can’t tell”. I have never had that response before. The crew stood and sat at the back chatting away having a great time. There were many of them and few passengers. A perfect opportunity to showcase individual, fantastic service. Unfortunately, the head of the cabin crew was at the back chatting with them all – so there was little leadership. After complaints from passengers, nothing changed. On take-off they did not remove our glasses, on landing they did not check that we were strapped in, they did not remove our cups and glasses once again. I choked on my breakfast and tried to call for help. I waved and pressed the service button. No one came. I managed to scramble out of my seat, balance my tray on the side and get to the bathroom where I vomited. The food was appalling, dry and over cooked. My tea was served cold. The attendant was so grumpy, rude and unhelpful that I actually asked her whether she’d had bad news from home. She said “I am tired!” I paid thousands of very hard-earned money for this flight – it is not the passengers’ job to do the work of the tired, disgruntled crew! They kept one toilet locked. They did not walk through the cabin to see if the passengers were ok. They did not help the mother with her 3 year old across the aisle from me. Airlines need to understand – we passengers no longer want glamour, lipstick, tight skirts and high heels – we want professional, great service from intelligent crew - happy to be in their highly sought-after jobs!",10,2019-07-04,Australia,True,dubai manchester worst cabin service experienced airline great expense took flight dubai manchester yesterday excited trying business class seat fly often say worst cabin crew ever experienced airline feel paid great holiday know passenger felt way upset talked plane afterwards moment boarding usual warm welcome greeted grumpy hostile cabin attendant brought breakfast menu later answer simple question ingredient say could please find meal precooked tell never response crew stood sat back chatting away great time many passenger perfect opportunity showcase individual fantastic service unfortunately head cabin crew back chatting little leadership complaint passenger nothing changed take remove glass landing check strapped remove cup glass choked breakfast tried call help waved pressed service button one came managed scramble seat balance tray side get bathroom vomited food appalling dry cooked tea served cold attendant grumpy rude unhelpful actually asked whether bad news home said tired paid thousand hard earned money flight passenger job work tired disgruntled crew kept one toilet locked walk cabin see passenger ok help mother year old across aisle airline need understand passenger longer want glamour lipstick tight skirt high heel want professional great service intelligent crew happy highly sought job

I could go on and list all the bad things but the most important thing you need to know is that they gave me a severe bout of food poisoning!!

"✅ Trip Verified |  Birmingham to Bangkok via Dubai. Despite recent reports about the extent to which Emirates’ quality of service has declined, I was impressed with every aspect of these two A380 flights. The limo pickup was on time with a friendly and helpful driver and there was only a short walk to business checkin. The Emirates lounge at Birmingham airport is spacious and well stocked and was only an equally short walk to the gate. Boarding was prompt and I will shown to my seat. There was a good choice of food and it was well served. My only criticism would have been the delay in bringing a glass of wine, forgetting my post-flight drink and having to ask to top it up. Apart from that the food was delicious and in a reasonable portions. The first A380 had the new design for the bar and there was a friendly group of passengers. The transfer at Dubai was quick and painless although allowing both economy and business passengers to exit through the same time did add some delay to exiting the aircraft. The flight to Bangkok was overnight and I chose to sleep. With the mattress, the seat was comfortable and I managed to sleep for a good three hours before being awoken for breakfast. The Wi-Fi connection on the plane was surprisingly stable and fast and there were enough movies to keep me entertained. Having flown on Emirates on a number of occasions in the past, I was relieved that although other accounts may be accurate, I found these two flights to high standard with nothing significant to complain about.

"✅ Trip Verified | ADD-DXB-BKK on 14th June 2019 on B777-300ER and A380, respectively. First Flight good and hardware good but food was a complete let down. I tried my special meal (acknowledge!) and all the other three menu dishes announced. All were absolutely substandard and not edible and I am not difficult and usually eat the dogs leftovers. But this was horrible and hazardous. Food in economy was edible and better than business. There was a cheese plate that helped me to avoid to starve. No ice creams and no inspirational additionals. Rate 6/10 Dubai-Bangkok was a great experience - as good as it gets on an airplane. A380 must be the king of the skies. Likely of my best flight ever, despite I had not slept the night before. I doubt that a general 1st class experience can beat this luxurious bz-class experience by Emirates on the A380. Simply outstanding on seat “hut”, meals, drinks. The onboard Sky Bar is a solid social effort and gimmick that is impressive and hard to dislike. I like the outer seats in the 1-2-1 biz-configuration with lots of space and great window access. The sports car design works well for me and the WiFi is solid and a bonus. Special meal was sophisticated and made to perfection.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Venice via Dubai. As a regular of Qatar and Etihad on the Singapore-Europe route, this was my first time with Emirates. I would not call it a total disappointment, but the company is definitely (and sadly) not worth its fame. Positive aspects: new aircrafts, comfortable Economy seats with decent pitch, nice food (plus points for the metal cutlery), efficient ground staff. Seat selection is not complimentary and the cost disproportionate: the cheapest option for each of the 4 legs of my journey would have increased the ticket price by around 17%! Cabin service is close to no-frill airlines: no hot towel, no amenity kit, no staff walking around the aisle with trays of drinks during sleeping hours. The inflight entertainment on the A380 was a quite unresponsive touch screen with cursor. Charging plugs are only available to window and central seat. Worse part: the staff. I was told that an increasing number of Europeans had joined Emirates from Ryanair and I was displeased to see the same attitude brought to the 4-star airline. Apart from the lack of smiles and rough replies to some passengers that I could hear, the staff onboard the SIN-DXB night flight had been talking and laughing loudly in the galley for at least one hour after the light were switched off, going in and out without caring to seal the courtains. I have not seen such behaviour even on cheap low-cost carriers like Scoot or AirAsia, where the staff at least excercises the basic courtesy of letting their passengers sleep.

"Not Verified |  Dubai to Hyderabad. I had booked a chauffeur drive at 13.05 on 03 June with pick up point and location details clearly marked on the map while booking online. After numerous calls with Driver, Call Center of Emirates nobody showed up to pick me up even after 13.45pm. After wasting and waiting for almost 50 minutes in hot sun, I finally took a Taxi and paid to reach business arrivals terminal and neither luggage concierge nor staff bothered to help me with my luggage from taxi nor to push the trolley. I met duty manager and explained whole story and all he said was it’s okay we apologize but now please board the flight as you are late. Such a horrible customer service I never expected from Emirates, especially when traveling in business class. On-Board Experience: It’s Ramadan (fasting month for Muslims) month and I was fasting. Cabin crew informed me if am fasting then food will be served when it’s time to break my fasting but I should order the food in advance so that I get served. When it was time of breaking my fasting I asked for the food that was ordered in advance and very surprisingly crew told sorry we can’t serve the food and you need to adjust with a small sandwich box as we are planning to land. When I questioned crew why did they promised me to order food in advance and how can they deny serving the food for a fasting person then crew simply said it’s our policy and we can’t help. When I became furious then they simply gave me a quick main course to eat but I felt their frustration while getting served. I wasn’t served the food which I had preordered despite crew having enough time (around one hour was left to land the flight). Most of the passengers sitting around me enjoyed full meal (all items of menu) but I had to go through this bad experience because I was fasting.

"Not Verified |  Emirates business class offers good seats (very good on the A380), excellent IFE, and fast transit times at DXB. Business and First Class lounges remain top-notch. FAs are generally kind and efficient. However, their pursers try too hard to welcome and do some chit-chat with gold and platinum members, while most of those frequent travellers just want some rest. Also, not clear why all safety and IFE introduction movies must be shown in 3 languages on some flights.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Manila. Emirates seems to be an airline where economy passengers are more important than business class passengers.  All hand carry was measured and weighed also for business class passengers. This is the first time on over 200 long haul business class flights I have ever experienced this. Reason: Business class is full of economy class passengers being upgraded. B777 is a wide body wide aircraft with 2 entrances. All economy passengers seated on the 2 aisle are boarded through the front door and has to pass through business class to get to their seat. As a business class passenger this means a lot of noise and commotion, no service until boarding is complete and being hit several times by carry on luggage. No service/bad service continued through out the flight with no drinks being offered during meals and no attention to passengers at all. It seemed the flight was understaffed due to a full business class.",10,2019-05-31,Philippines,True,dubai manila emirate seems airline economy passenger important business class passenger hand carry measured weighed also business class passenger first time long haul business class flight ever experienced reason business class full economy class passenger upgraded b wide body wide aircraft entrance economy passenger seated aisle boarded front door pas business class get seat business class passenger mean lot noise commotion service boarding complete hit several time carry luggage service bad service continued flight drink offered meal attention passenger seemed flight understaffed due full business class
"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked the flight from Warsaw to Delhi via Dubai. Flight originally was planned for 24th of May at 12:50, departure from Dubai at 21:25. On Sunday, 19th of May, my partner received information that there were shcedule changes in the itinerary. We called immediately as they rescheduled our flight for 13rd of May (day earlier that we booked originally). Additionally, instead of 1,5 hrs. of transfer they changed for 13hrs at Dubai Airport. They informed us that they cannot do anything about it because our flight has been cancelled. We said we cannot fly on 23rd due to our duties etc. and they said they all come back in the morning and asked us to call. So, we call in the morning and lady said that there is a flight from Warsaw to Dubai on 24th (as originally planned) but we need to wait 13 hrs. at Dubai airport and there is no other option as flight from Dubai to Delhi at 21:25 was cancelled. Not having a choice, we decided to take this flight having in mind that we need to be in Delhi on Sunday. We reached Dubai on 24th of May and we saw that the flight from Dubai to New Delhi has not been cancelled and departure was ongoing what means that they lie to us saying that the flight was cancelled. Once we noticed, we run to the reservation desk, was huge line but finally we asked if we can change the flight for 21:25 as originally planned. They said no, we cannot it is already overbooked, and boarding is closed. She said there is an option at 3 am as well but it is also overbooked, 30 people on the list so she all not adds to the waiting list even. Not having a choice, we decided to go out from the airport because no one told us that emirates should give us a hotel.  Once we came back from center of Dubai we checked once again if there are some places may be at 3. Lady from reservation desk told us it is too late now to onboard but there were places and u should have been added on the waiting list, we said we asked to add, and emirate reservation service told us that it does not make sense.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to New York JFK. We couldn’t afford buying a Business ticket since it was way too expensive so we started using AMEX credit card to get as many miles as possible and use them for the upgrade. Finally after a few months spending money and taking advantage of different promotions we collected more than half of the miles, the rest we bought them through emirates website (very expensive!). First problem started a week before our trip when we tried to reserve the chauffeur Emirates offer for Business class passengers, apparently they remove it from miles upgraded tickets a week before we made the upgrade (they didn’t say it unless you try to actually use it and they tell you that you can’t due to the type of ticket). Emirates has a direct flight from Dubai to FLL but upgrade tickets where not available when we bought them so we decided to go through JFK with our upgrade ticket, since we were coming from Bangkok we arrived at Dubai airport at midnight and our flight to JFK departed 8:15am (8hours stopover), during our honeymoon I checked the Dubai-FLL flight multiple times until we saw tickets available for upgrade, so we called Emirates to change it (this change would make us arrive at FLL 12 hours earlier since the stop over in Dubai was only 2 hours and we didn’t have to stop in JFK for another 3 hours and take an extra flight) the guy in the phone told us that through the phone he couldn’t guarantee that we would get business seats in the new flight since he had to revert the upgrade, transfer the economy ticket and request the upgrade again, but he recommended us to do it at the airport, if they had seats available they would be able to do it without a problem. When we got to Bangkok airport I checked online once again and the seats where still available so we spoke with the Senior Lounge Agent, she was extremely unhelpful and harsh with us, first I tried to explain the situation nicely but she didn’t care, and her response was “I’m sorry but in order to change we have to revert back the upgrade and the miles take 24-48 hours to be back in your account so you wont be able to upgrade for this flight”. It is disappointing because the guy over the phone told us exactly the opposite (wait until you get to the airport) and second because you are flying in business paying a lot of money (or a lot of miles) but they don’t seem to care, also since you have an upgrade ticket is for them as if you still have your economy ticket the attention is really bad.

✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Hong Kong. Trip was relatively nice. Checked in around 11:PM at Suvarnabhumi International airport located the Emirates counter all the way at the back. What I found a bit strange that they were still about 4 or 5 people ahead of us in the business class counter and the first class counter was completely empty. Once checked in we (finally) didn’t have to go to the payment counter for overweight luggage since we had around 40KG baggage allowance. Got fast track passes so the security and immigration was a breeze.Once customs was over we headed to the lounge and had some water and tea. (Didn’t eat much not gonna lie) then we checked the Duty free a bit and headed to the gate. We got priority boarding so we didn’t have to wait that much. We entered the aero bridge and were welcomed by the cabin crew and located our assigned seats. Legroom was very decent the recline seating options were amazing for me and the flat bed was really easy and effective. IFE was amazing and the screen was fairly large.The headphones worked well and so did the tray table functions. What I found very useful was the storage space beside my seat. It even had its own minibar with Evian and Perrier and something else (not gonna lie I don’t remember). The food was ok p(not the best) and so was the onboard lounge and restrooms. Slept for about a hour since the flight is pretty short. And arrived at Hong Kong International Airport. Took the airport train and headed to immigration.Unfortunately there wasn’t any fast track immigration for premium passengers on arrival like in BKK.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Dubai. 1st leg: fr Sofia to Istanbul by Turkish Airlines (Apr 26:16-17:15) 2nd leg: fr Istanbul to Dubai (Apr 26: 19:25- Apr 27: 1pm) 3rd leg: fr Dubai to HK First, when I checked in online, the system said since the first leg was operated by Turkish, I could not do so. When I checked in in Sofia, Turkish  said I needed to get my other boarding passes from Emirates in Istanbul. The arrival time from Sofia to Istanbul was delayed by 15 mins & it took about 15 mins for the plane to drive to the parking terminal. Since my seat was at the end of the plane, it took another 15 mins for me to leave the plane. Then I ran around to find the transfer desk of Emirates. But I couldn't find any sign in the airport indicating where it was & the airport is very large. I asked many airport staff but they either did not know it or pointed me in the wrong direction. Finally I could find one airport staff member pointed me to the right location. When I arrived at the transfer desk, it was about 18:28 & the Celebi staff representing Emirates was not there & someone went inside the office behind to get him out. After he was out & checked the system, he said the checkin was closed.  He called his supervisor to see if they could let me check in. The answer was NO & he could not do anything else. I was angry because there was still about an hour before takeoff. He then said since my previous plane was delayed for 15 mins, Turkish should bear the responsibility. I then approached Turkish Airlines and asked 2 different staff members, they said 15 mins was just a short time & there was still about an hour before the next plane took off. Then there came the deadlock. I looked like an idiot running between the 2 airlines. They all treated me in bad attitude at the end, thinking I was a trouble maker. So the only thing I could do then was to book another air ticket. It costed me HK$4259.08 & 30 hours more. To me, I cannot understand why I couldn't check in when there was still about an hour before takeoff. I've just called Emirates' customer service, they said I must check in 1 hour before takeoff.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Brussels via Dubai. I've flown them roughly every three years or so for the last two decades and they seem as good as ever. They're not perfect, and some other carriers have done a good job of catching up (particularly in economy class) but Emirates is still one of the better choices. The check in team and gate agents are efficient and patient. I had a problem with my mobile boarding pass not scanning and they were able to print me a new paper one with a smile. The aircraft was an older 777, but still mostly functional--there was a problem with the seat recline on my second segment. The entertainment system is good, but trying to cater to every culture they serve means the pool of options for English is pretty shallow. I was able to keep myself entertained, but just barely. Comedy is a weak spot for sure. The two hours of free wifi is good, but the connection is pretty poor. Emirates food is decent, though one flight only had an option of lamb or cod. Those are both rather specific tastes, I'd have been happier if they had gone with at least one safer choice of beef, chicken, or pasta. But the food was good and the desserts definitely stand out. Emirates doesn't stack up to the Asian carriers in terms of frequently circulating with water between meals, but the crew seemed service focused enough that you would get some if you asked. Connecting in Dubai is not a great experience. It's not as horrible as Doha but there is an amazing lack of plumbing in the airport, ensuring long lines at the toilets. Add to that some really extensive walks to get from gate to gate, and I'd be wary of advising any mobility impaired friends to try this without assistance. The flights were close to on time, but both arrived a little bit late without any logical explanation--no headwinds, ATC delays, or other obvious issues.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Newcastle to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai . I have flown with Emirates on and off for years, and you can really see cost cutting and staff attitudes changing, on my flights anyway. Their bar service is non existent more or less, you get offered a drink with your meal, and thats about it, if you want a drink of anything you have to keep ring for service, which most folk like myself dont like to do. No hot towels on getting on the craft, your just left, food has notably gone down in quality too! On the second leg of the flight, it was a 4.20am takeoff, we were left without so much as a drink of water for 3 hours, i had medication to take and asked them for water, , they must have a water shortage! It was brought in an eggcup size cup. Eventually got brought a substandard breakfast, which has been so chilled its lost all its flavour, no alcohol offered on this flight. The service has massively changed, you can really see it is like the staff cant be bothered, just wanna chuck the food at you, so they can rest and talk in the galley. I paid £700 for my flight and felt ripped off, it would put me off travelling with them again.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Prague to Bangkok via Dubai. I am very disappointed about the quality and service provided by the Emirates. It started at the check-in desk where I have checked 1 luggage and explicitly asked the staff member as I carry a lot of camera, lens, cables etc, if I can have drone (small size) with me in cabin bag. I was told yes, you don`t have to have it in checked baggage. Then at the security check right before the boarding gate I was told and forced to put drone into checked luggage, but I was not provided any bag for that and that I have to take care of it myself that it`s my mistake I was told by Emirates staff at the gate, BUT thanks to local security officers on airport (not emirates staff) They helped me to find bag, some papers and airbags to secure the drone. I said OK nice start, but then it continued with the service onboard. The menu was served after 2 hours after the take off and no walkaround of staff around. No water offer, only if you come by person to staff asking for water or something. The food was average - good taste, selection of 2 main food chicken vs beef and drinks. I asked for a beer and I was told they run out of beer. so I asked for Gin and Soda, and I was told, I dont have it with me but if you wait 10-15 minutes I will get it right back for you, and I waited approx 20 mins to get the gin and tonic.

The hot food was very good with a good choice of Asian dishes, and we especially loved the freshly made to order dumplings. The only let down was that they served Moet and not Veuve Cliquot which was what was previously on offer. On board the cabin layout of 3-2-3 was disappointing and the seat comfort was not good. However the aircraft was very clean and well maintained. The service to start off was a bit hit and miss, although did improve after the meal service. Champagne on board again was only Moet. The promised drinks after takeoff was not delivered until we reminded them and also the wines we had already ordered with our meals did not eventuate until reminded a couple of times.

"✅ Trip Verified | First time for a long time with Emirates - normally I would use Etihad, and first time A380 business class. Overall, a curates's egg. However, you come to expect more from Emirates particularly given the cost of their flights. The good points: check in and bag delivery was excellent, as was the chauffeur service to / from DXB. The cabin appeared spotless, though all was not as it seemed. The crew were immaculate and charming if a little robotic. The quibbles: boarding at DXB was chaotic. It should not take nearly 2 hours to clear queuing passengers into the gate, the flight eventually leaving 90 minutes behind schedule. On the flight to CAN I was not welcomed onboard, or offered a drink, or a drink order taken on the return. If paying top dollar there is an expectation FAs keep tabs on their assigned passengers. However, the biggest disappointment was the food. I'd pre-ordered vegetarian. On the outward leg I was presented what I considered at the time to be the most uninspired slop I'd seen in nearly 50 years of flying, boiled mixed vegetables in a tasteless sauce on couscous. Until my return flight, that is. A 'dish' of boiled noodles with a squirt of neat tomato puree on top and accompanies by half a dozen near raw peas in their pods. The excellent sweet did not compensate. The FA apologized and offered any selection from the menu as an alternative. Trouble is, unlike other full fare airlines, including for economy class (Etihad), Emirates offers no vegetarian - or vegan - options. One assumes Emirates' management would rather vegetarians stay away. Henceforth I shall duly support this policy. I strongly recommend other vegetarians do likewise. Finally, I enjoy watching wildlife programmes as part of IFE. What I appreciate less is being 'entertained' through the night by the antics of a cockroach presumably making its way home through my seating area disappearing into the seat recess in front. Where there's one there'll be many more.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I was very much looking forward to Emirates flight and had pre-set expectations of high standards of service and comfort. I was traveling with my Mother on the flight and I must say that the flight was pretty average nowhere close to Emirates brand of service. A couple of gripes on their Boeing 777 from Mumbai - Dubai - flown 07 March 2019. Inattentive cabin crew - No response to hostess call bell multiple times, had to verbally call out for assistance.  No water provided on boarding the aircraft and you had to ask for water and that also was cheaply been distributed in open plastic glasses the way they do it by the road side in India pouring out of packaged drinking water bottles. For more than an hour no water or snacks were offered and the food that was served was average and that was it, no munchies or a bottle of water before the dinner was served. Getting a glass of juice was a challenge and everything was being served very stingily. 5The flight seats are of very poor width since the flight is crammed with lot many seats per row, the food tray could barely fit on it. Uncomfortable aisles and poor comfort overall. The positive -  The inflight entertainment and camera view, that was the only saving grace.  Comparatively new flight and clean upholstery.

"✅ Trip Verified | What happened on EK-001 on 9th May 2019? I've flown Emirates many times with excellent service, but this flight was disgusting. I get a special meal, gluten free, so my food arrived 30 mins before the general rush, then the normal food distribution. The food trays were then left (on people's laps) for maybe '4 hours'. This made it awkward to get up as one had to ask a neighbour to hold your tray plus their tray to go the toilet. I plan my in-flight experience down to exactly which seat and which meal, to minimise inconvenience, but this didn't work on EK-001 (09/05/19). Drinks trolleys were abandoned opposite toilets making for less space to stand. The flight standard was all the worse because I had just got off the excellent flight from Perth, Australia, arriving at gate A1 departing gate A3. It was such a shock coming from a serene feeling on a flight inbound to their Dubai hub, and the excellent experience in their hub, plus the great flights out to Australia. It genuinely felt as if the stewards were on strike. (This was the flight where we were told at the end, suitcases in hand, packed in the aisles, to return to our allocated seats because the British police were coming on board.). Come on, Emirates!

"✅ Trip Verified |  After 1 month in Thailand and the prospect of coming home to rainy Scotland, I decided to treat myself and upgrade my original economy ticket to business class. Okay I'll get all the positives out the way first. Great lounge at BKK, fully stocked with drinks and all the food I had was very tasty and prepared to a high standard. Seat and all the amenities that come with it were spot on, this is for the A380. The B777 is a more cramped affair altogether, so if you can, fly on the A380 - this applies to economy as well. I loved relaxing at the A380 bar area, watching the football on the big screen, whilst enjoying a freshly made cocktail, bliss! Now the negative, yes, just one, but it's a biggie and that would be the service. Now, don't get me wrong, there were some very pleasant FA's, albeit a bit false but as for the others it's the reason I won't fly Emirates again. After dinner I had a full glass of champagne in front of me, the FA tried to snatch it away, I don't understand this and why would you not ask the customer if they are finished? Needless to say, I snatched it back, much to the FA's annoyance, forgive me for wanting to finish my drink when I'm paying good money. Another point is the staff just hanging around the bar towards the end of the flight, as thought it was their own staff room, I wanted to just chill and spend the last couple hours of my flight reading my book but this just totally put me off. I work in hospitality myself and believe those areas are for the customer and the customer only not for staff to drape themselves over. Upon arrival at the lounge in Dubai, I gave my ticket to receptionist and as I was off a flight and a bit tired I made the heinous mistake of going the wrong way ""Where are you going sir"" was said to me in the tone of ""what are doing you complete and utter buffoon"", not pleasant in the slightest, such a sour character and one you wonder why bother working with the public? So in a nutshell, great food, IFE, seats etc etc. But very, average service, bordering on downright rude at times. For this reason I'll be trying Singapore in future and avoiding Emirates entirely.

"Not Verified |  We travelled Emirates yet again because we are moving back to England. This one-way flight was a pleasant one. The airport wasn't a pigsty like it usually is when we travel in the summertime. The cabin staff and ground staff are very friendly. When we were at the airport, however, we had to pay AED120 for baggage wrapping only because they didn't have plastic, which isn't very fair, but anyhow. Boarding gate was pretty busy and it was a full flight. It was fairly pleasant on board - no screaming babies for the majority of the duration of flight but just when we took off there was one family with a crying baby. ICE is great but children's selection of films is lousy. Good music on the flight - almost every song i wanted to listen to E-section (Entertainment) had.

(20 minutes) she said it’s fine I need to wait in the queue. of about 19/20 counters there was one person working. There was about 9 passengers in front of me. I waited as told. When I reached the counter finally the lady told me I missed my check in (by 5 minutes) as I was waiting. She refused to help or assist and told me I need to speak to another counter. The manager that he is just said I need to rebook and it’s not his problem. As I booked my flight through a third party (my fault) and was checked in already I lost both my flights as I was a no show. This cost me AED 4500 roughly.

"✅ Trip Verified | I and my wife took the flight from Cape Town to Dubai (EK773) and Dubai to Hong Kong (EK382) on 27 Apr to 28 Apr 2019. After we alight the flight (EK773) in Dubai airport at the remote bay, I immediately recalled that I left 3 bottles of liquor on the aircraft during the bus ride to the terminal. It was about 00:30L 28 Apr 2019. Once we arrived at the terminal, we sought help from an Emirates staff, he asked me to go to the information desk. Then we sought the information desk to help, the information desk staff refer me to the transit connection counter. Then we went to connection counter to ask for help. The connection counter staff asked us to wait for one hour there, she said she would see if anyone retrieved anything from the aircraft. Please note that at this point, no staff took note of any of our PAX information. I waited for an hour and went back to the connection counter. The encounter staff dialled Lost & Found and simply passed me the phone to me. The Lost & Found said the aircraft has not been cleared, nothing has retrieved from the aircraft. Since it was about the boarding time for our next flight, I asked my wife to head to the boarding gate and ask the gate staff to help and I waited for 15 mins more. Once my wife arrived at the gate and asked for help. Again, the gate staff simply passed the phone to my wife and asked her to talk to Lost & Found. At this time, the Lost & Found lady told my wife the aircraft has been cleared and nothing has been retrieved. I arrived at the gate 15 mins later. I was so angry because no ground staff were trying to help and none of them seemed care at all. Their service attitude was terrible! The gate staff explained that maybe other PAX took them. I claimed that we were the last PAX to alight the aircraft since we knew we have 3 hrs for transit therefore we didn't need to rush. At this point, we gave up and entered the waiting area at Gate A8. 15 mins later, I decided to ask the gate staff to call the Lost & Found again and let me talk to the Lost & Found directly. This time, the Lost & Found staff told me the aircraft has not been cleared, nothing has been retrieved yet. What is going on? I told her no one recorded any of my PAX information. Then she asked me to send an e-mail to [email protected] as it is the standard procedure for Emirates. I sent the e-mail right away and they acknowledged my query. 24 hours has passed and I still hear nothing! This was my first time flying with Emirates and it was terrible!

"✅ Trip Verified | Had 2 great flights from Kuwait to Dubai and back with Emirates. The last time I flown Emirates was back in 2015, I then switched to Qatar Airways which I found is better. My recent flight with Emirates was great overall. But yes, their services went down (seat selection no longer free, 25kg only for Economy Class, no more hot towels served prior to departure in Economy Class. Other negatives are: WiFi was available but not working on both flights. IFE Box under the seats blocking some legroom. Very tiring boarding organization unlike Qatar Airways, Emirates closes the gate 45 minutes prior to departure time, while Qatar Airways closes the gate 20 minutes prior to departure time. Emirates’s 45 minutes causes a long long queue. Postives, good and comfortable seats, the 10-abreast B777-300ER is decent, not as bad as people say. Of course I won’t deny the Award-Winning Excellent ICE Entertainment System. Despite both flights were operated on old planes with very unresponsive touch screens, the movies selection were up-to-date. Very friendly cabin crew, excellent meal service for a 1 hour 30 minutes flight. Clean cabin, beautiful and luxury Orange-Colored-mood-lighting system.

"Not Verified |  Vienna to Sulaymaniyah via Dubai. We missed our connection flight with another airline company and were unable to get a continuing flight with that company for another 3 days. We searched the other airlines and could fly with Emirates within 4 hours - best decision we made! When we checked in they noted that we have 3 young children and changed our seats so we could have the front row seats enabling us to sit together and also be able to use their onboard cot for our 9 month old. Once on board the flight attendants were very helpful and friendly. They attached the baby cot to the divider, my 2 older children, 6 & 3, saw the baby pack and wanted the blankets as they came with penguins (didn’t say anything, they just poured!) and they were more than happy to supply these for them. The children’s food was a good selection of food they actually ate, we were checked on regularly and we found the flight more relaxing than we’d expected travelling with 3 small children!

"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Dubai return. EK18 on 17th April 2019 was great - staff were friendly and helpful, food good, everything nice. Great first impressions of the airline. Flight EK19 back to Manchester on 24th April 2019 not so good. Family to our right let their 3 or 4 year old daughter play in the aisle for approx 5 of the 7 hours flight, she was jumping up and down banging on the floor, swinging on seats, hit my son and staff never said a word at any point even though she was constantly in their way/playing next to other passengers further down the plane, even when they were eating. The father was sat on the aisle seat but made not 1 single attempt to control his daughter, he looked like everything was an effort (except eating the extra meals he asked for, and got) and instead put his headphones on/snoozed whilst his daughter roamed about (in between asking staff for things out of sequence instead of waiting to be served like the rest of us). Was disappointed with the lack of staff response, it ruined our flight. The man had an air of entitlement for some reason, even though his family had 3 seats so, in a way, us families next to him with 4 seats had paid more to be there yet got a worse service (I know it doesn't work like that but it is annoying when 1 passenger thinks they are above everyone else). To make it worse a man had been moved from his rightful seat to accommodate the family in those seats (they had missed their earlier flight so were put on this one instead), which was annoying in hindsight - we would all have had a nice flight in zone D if the original man seated there had not been forced to move. I also paid for extra wifi on both journeys and then it didn't work! Waste of £20!

"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Manila via Dubai. Was recommended by a colleague to fly Emirates business class. What I was surprised about was I experienced 2 very different business class products – I was totally shocked at the difference. London to Dubai was on an Airbus and Dubai to Manila a Boeing 777. The Airbus flight was aligned to business class travel expectations, seat was reasonably comfortable, large selection of IFE, food was of a good quality. My only quibbles were the seat belt length seemed quite short – it was tight on me and not something I experienced on other airlines; staff helped when asked but otherwise didn’t offer. The Boeing product is significantly inferior – uncomfortable seating and it was not lie flat, no storage at all, 2-3-2 configuration, no amenity kit etc, slow food service with a very limited selection. The Boeing flight is like flying premium economy – a good amount of leg room and a wider seat (seat belt size was much longer) but that’s as much as I can positively say about it. It was a really uncomfortable flight for me given it was close to 9 hours – I felt cheated for having paid for a business class seat. Regrettably, I had 2 more business class flights that week with Emirates which were not refundable otherwise I would have cancelled. Flew HKG to Dubai on an Boeing 777 - just as bad (if not worse) than the Manila flight. What storage existed was used by the cabin staff, myself and 2 other passengers had to store our cabin bags several rows behind us in a single overhead – we had to do this ourselves, no help or interest from cabin staff. Food was awful. Lounge in Dubai served excellent food and beverages and had some nice quiet seating areas. However, if you wanted some F&B getting it was a bit of a challenge - I witnessed only 2 serving stations for main courses and tea/coffee - despite being there for over an hour, never did manage to be able to get through the endless throng to get a cup of tea.

"✅ Trip Verified | Probably the worst flight I ever had with EK since I started flying with them 13 years ago. My route was DXB-CAI and return both ways were with very old outdated B777. First of all EK stopped handing hot towels prior to take off, inflight magazines are removed from the seat pocket probably to reduce cost. On the way DXB-CAI we boarded on time however there was a delay of 1 full hour sitting on board with no explanation. Crew didn’t even bother to serve water or a juice and no explanation from the captain, secondly my headphones were not working properly due to the age of the aircraft and I had to keep holding it. Seat was broken and always reclining however I informed the crew but nothing happened, they kept asking me to adjust my seat to up position and I kept telling them it was broken. On the way back it was the opposite, it wouldn’t recline at all. The food service also has dropped a lot with the quality of the meal service and the portions which have become similar to what you get on a Low cost. When arrived back to Dubai also 30 mins late the luggage was delayed for more than an hour, they announced on the speakers but no explanation which led to being late for my early morning meeting as was supposed to land at 7:10am and had meeting at 9:30 am but I had to cancel it and of course no explanation or visibility of EK staff.

"✅ Trip Verified | Flight EK191 on 19th March had aircraft change from 777-300 to 777-200. We always reserve (at extra cost) dual seats of row 48 but were re-allocated to seats row 37 which on the seat map look identical. However, on boarding we found that 3 extra rows had added and row 37 was a normal triple seat. The purser apologised and moved us to the only double row available in row 39 - the one with fixed arm rests and of-set screens.

Because of the extra rows seat pitch is now 31"" and not the 33"" - 34"" shown on the seat map.

Manchester to Dubai. Emirates is vastly overrated. Good inflight entertainment but that is it. Poor impersonal service that was surly, their cabin crew are far from the best. The whole experience lacked any character and as for the afternoon tea before landing - their version of a sandwich is a literally one quarter of what even the most diet conscious would expect.

"✅ Trip Verified | London Gatwick to Islamabad via Dubai. My first time on Emirates. I had heard good things about this airline in the past so decided to give it a go. Baggage drop-off at Gatwick was fine. The gate at Gatwick was horrible, a small space to accommodate all economy class passenger of an A380. Most of us had to stand for a long time before boarding commenced as the seating at the gate were totally inadequate. My seat on the A380 was comfortable but the IFE did not work. The seat would not recline either. The stewardess tried to help but ended up apologizing for the broken IFE and seat. The meal service was good and the quality of food reasonable, however, the portion sizes were very small. The flight from Dubai to Islamabad was not good at all. Boarding at Dubai was chaotic, Most passengers were not allowed to take their hand luggage on board with them as according the staff at the gate the flight was full and there would not be enough space on the plane for hand luggage despite the fact that most people had just one item of hand luggage with them. The boarding process took a long time and the gate staff didn't seem too bothered. The seats on Boeing 777-300ER were extremely uncomfortable, the legroom was very tight and the seat width was also very cramped. Shortly after boarding completed, the cabin lights were switched off with on the screens and seat belt signs providing any light. The captain announced that we would be delayed due to heavy traffic along our flight path. No cabin crew were around to answer any queries and any calls for them were ignored. We eventually left Dubai over an hour late. The rest of the flight was unremarkable. The crew were not very friendly and didn't seem too bothered. The breakfast was ok but again the portion size was very small. After landing the I noticed that most of the cabin crew seemed absent with only one stewardess standing by the door. She did not bother to smile or say goodbye to anyone.",9,2019-04-09,United Kingdom,True,london gatwick islamabad via dubai first time emirate heard good thing airline past decided give go baggage drop gatwick fine gate gatwick horrible small space accommodate economy class passenger u stand long time boarding commenced seating gate totally inadequate seat comfortable ife work seat would recline either stewardess tried help ended apologizing broken ife seat meal service good quality food reasonable however portion size small flight dubai islamabad good boarding dubai chaotic passenger allowed take hand luggage board according staff gate flight full would enough space plane hand luggage despite fact people one item hand luggage boarding process took long time gate staff seem bothered seat boeing er extremely uncomfortable legroom tight seat width also cramped shortly boarding completed cabin light switched screen seat belt sign providing light captain announced would delayed due heavy traffic along flight path cabin crew around answer query call ignored eventually left dubai hour late rest flight unremarkable crew friendly seem bothered breakfast ok portion size small landing noticed cabin crew seemed absent one stewardess standing door bother smile say goodbye anyone
"Not Verified |  Oslo to Singapore via Dubai. I expected something more from an airline like Emirates. My friends who have flown with them, told me that has very good food in economy class, and the cabin crew are friendly. This is the opposite of what I have experienced. My first flight was from Oslo to Dubai on the 21st of March. We flew with a Boeing 777, reg A6-EWC. Before the flight, I was happy that I could use the ICE, an internationally awarded In-flight entertainment system. I was really disappointed when I touched the screen, because it was unusable. The screen heated up to 40-50 degrees, and the touch didn't work well. The food was OK, but again, I expected something more from an airline like Emirates. Two members of the cabin crew were rude to me. The flight from Dubai to Singapore with A388 was really good. Plenty of legroom under the seat in front of me. Back to Oslo, I have ordered Vegetarian meal to try something different (I had Asian vegetarian meal from OSL to SIN). I was angry when they gave me vegan food. Is it so hard to see the difference between Vegetarian and vegan food?. It was definitely the worst meal I have eaten on an airplane. I recommend to choose an another airline if you have a possibility to do so. I could fly cheaper with Finnair or  Qatar airways, but i choose Emirates only because they had the A380.",8,2019-04-08,Norway,False,verified oslo singapore via dubai expected something airline like emirate friend flown told good food economy class cabin crew friendly opposite experienced first flight oslo dubai st march flew boeing reg ewc flight happy could use ice internationally awarded flight entertainment system really disappointed touched screen unusable screen heated degree touch work well food ok expected something airline like emirate two member cabin crew rude flight dubai singapore really good plenty legroom seat front back oslo ordered vegetarian meal try something different asian vegetarian meal osl sin angry gave vegan food hard see difference vegetarian vegan food definitely worst meal eaten airplane recommend choose another airline possibility could fly cheaper finnair qatar airway choose emirate
"✅ Trip Verified | I expected something more from Emirates. I've heard many pros about the airline from my friends who have flown with Emirates and an ex-Emirates stewardess. What I experienced, is the opposite of what they told me. They told me that the food is the best food you can eat in economy class. I have also read that the ICE intertainment system is the best IFE system in the world. I do not agree at all. My first flight was from Oslo to Dubai, flight number EK 160. We flew with a Boeing 777, reg A6-EWC. I was excited to try the ICE, so the first thing I did after I found my seat was to try the system. I was very disappointed when I realized, that the screen's temperature is over 40 degrees, and the touch works badly. The sound from the headphones was also very noisy, I think that DACs in the aircraft were maybe broken. I ordered Asian Vegetarian meal (AVML) on their website before the flight. Agian, I expected something more from a 4 star airline like Emirates. The food was just OK, nothing more than that. The next flight was from Dubai to Singapore with an A380, reg A6-EOT. The A380 was the best long haul plane I have flown with. There was a lot of legroom, and place next to the seat (I had a window seat) to leave small things like a pillow or your headsets. This time, the ICE worked well, and was more advanced than the old crap in the 777. Unfortunately, the cabin crew were rude and they didn't care about the passengers as much as the cabin crew in KLM or even AirAsia. I saw them only when twice when they gave food to the pax. On the way back to Oslo, I ordered Vegetarian meal. I was shocked, when they came with a Vegan meal. Is it so hard to see the difference? All other airlines offer vegeterian food or even lacto-ovo vegetarian etc. Also, I don't recommend the meal for those who are Vegans. It was really disgusting, and it was too warm. I will never recommend this airline to anybody.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Beirut to Colombo via Dubai. The flights were comfortable both ways and Emirates staff on board were helpful and friendly but on our way back from Colombo to Dubai we had a short layover and our first flight was delayed and then parked miles from the terminal, necessitating a long bus ride and meaning that we rushed to make our connection. When we arrived at our gate we enquired if our bags would make the connection and were told that they were in the process of being transferred. Our flights was then delayed by the gate for 30 minutes, leaving plenty of time for the bags to be loaded. Despite this, when we arrived in Beirut, we received a message to say our luggage wasn't on the plane and would arrive on the next flight, eight hours later. We were told by ground staff that it could not be delivered and we would have to return to the airport to collect it. It took us almost an hour to find the Emirates office and someone who would help us. He promised that if we returned that evening to collect the bags the office would be open and Emirates staff would help us and would reimburse our taxi costs. When we got back, the office was closed and locked and no one answered the phone. We tried going back three times over the course of an hour. No one was there. Eventually we got our bags but the process meant we lost almost four hours of our day and over $30 in additional taxi costs. Finally, as we were leaving the airport, Emirates staff called us to say that they were at baggage claim, though we had already been there to get our bags and seen no sign of them. When we explained that we had already left the airport, they told us to come back, despite the fact that we had already lost all the money on the extra taxis, not to mention our one free day back at home to prepare before going back to work.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Dubai. First time flying Emirates business class and was excited to try it but very disappointed after my experience. No greeting by any of the staff even the check in staff. I got the middle seat and felt very claustrophobic. If you are also going as a couple or with a friend, it’s hard to carry a conversation with the person you are flying next to since the divider in between doesn’t even go down completely. On a long plane ride, this is very frustrating that you cannot even carry a proper conversation or see the person next to you. In terms of the service, the stewardess serving me was lazy and made me hand her all the trays and hand myself all the plates rather than setting it down directly on the table. I thought this is very unsafe since some dishes are very hot. She was also too lazy to make the bed for me so I had to do it myself. Not only that but one of the stewardesses left the tray on the seat in front of us which crashing down in front of my boyfriends feet during the middle of the flight. The head flight attendant walking by noticed it and didn’t even apologize and rather asked us abruptly what had happened like it was our fault his staff left the tray there. There are also no slippers or pajamas offered like other flights. The food is also not personalized and not very good. They didn’t even offer us dessert and when we asked for it, they assumed someone had already taken our order and didn’t give us the dessert. Most of all, the airport lounge in Dubai on the way to another city is really outdated, basic and unimpressive. It’s really long and big but composed of the same basic food drinks and no amenities other than a few shower rooms. The spa which was on the map was closed and half the loung was also closed when we were there for no reasons given. All the other major airlines business class I had taken including cathay, Singapore airlines, korean air and Etihad had much better lounges. I especially expected more since Emirates is Dubai’s flagship carrier but it looks like they cut costs severely. Would not take Emirates again although I already bought several more tickets for the rest of the leg of this trip that I cannot cancel. Some positives were chauffeur service, private entrance at gate for customs and security check in the Dubai airport, and the entertainment system on the plane which had a lot of movies.

"✅ Trip Verified | I and my husband are 71 years old, flying regularly twice a year for many years and this flight was our worst flying experience ever! This flight was 6 hours long and we purchased the tickets with Emirates based on their advertising and did not mind paying almost double price than all the other companies charge. We wanted on this pretty long flight more comfort, wider seats, more legroom, good food and overall better experience as Emirates advertise. The outbound flight was with Emirates partner company FLy Dubai, Boeing 737Max not Airbus 380 as they advertise. Nothing of the advertisement was true. The airplane had regular narrow seats and little legroom and there was no complimentary drinks and food at all. This is almost criminal! Yes, you could buy drinks and food but why you pay almost double price to fly with this company? Their advertisement is fraudulent. On this journey we also flew from Abu Dhabi to Muscat with Oman Air. The flight was only 60 min. long and complimentary drinks and luncheon was served. Than we flew from Muscat back to Dubai with Swiss Air. On this only 50 min. long flight complimentary water and snack was served. The inbound flight with Emirates was not bad, Airbus 380, little wider seats and little more legroom, complimentary drinks and food. Nothing really great but OK. I complained to Emirates about our outbound flight without any successful result.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Kathmandu via Dubai. Never fly in their partnership flights We love Emirates. We fly with them even if it is few hundred dollars expensive or a couple of hours longer journey. Appreciate lovely crews, wifi, comfortable seats and food. However, I found that their connection and transit service is worst (cannot compare with any other airport standard) at Dubai and they don’t respect passengers flying with them in partnership arrangements.  Emirates took off 25 min late from SYD. It took additional 20 min to reach to gate at Dubai. Almost 45 min late. Hardly 1 Hr and a bit left for my next flight to KTM. As there was no one waiting at the plane gate, I rushed to Emirates connection centre at Dubai. The response I got there was very upsetting. They were not helping me because my other flight was with flyDubai (which I did not notice earlier as I booked this thru Emirates). Gate number of my flight was not displayed in the Boards. No one helped me, they asked me to wait the gate number to be displayed, which never did. I missed the flight, because the Emirates was late and their information system was not good. They did not bother to help us because we were only 3 passengers in this connection. The following flyDubai flight to KTM was over-booked, so we had to wait next Oman Air flight via Mascot. I reached KTM approx. 18 hrs late to find another surprise. My little suitcase was broken. I made a complain at Sydney and claimed for missing goods. Emirates responded to me in 7 days as - “it is the airline industry policy and agreement between airlines. Oman Air has a direct responsibility to resolve your claim.. suggest that you contact Oman Air.” I was expecting something better than this from Emirates Airlines.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Washington to Jeddah via Dubai. I am a fan of Emirates and have flown quite a lot of miles on it. I  feel like Emirate's quality of service is declining very fast.

The staff in Kabul insisted that I could not take a carry on with me because it was a kilo over the limit whereas I saw others carrying much larger bags than my little carry on bag.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Manila to Cape Town via Dubai. Emirates has been incredibly disappointing on so many fronts. The Special meal I ordered didn't show up. As opposed to being super apologetic the airline crew was just rather indifferent. Also the regular meals provided in business class were terrible. Business class felt like economy class service. Staff came out when there was meal service and otherwise just huddled in the cabin and chatted outside of that. Really got the distinct impression that I was bothering them every time I had to go to the cabin to get water. They used to be better. Not sure what happened to this airline. Airport Transfer:  security check points to transfer from one gate to another along with an arduous bus ride. Amenities: Nice Kit but no slippers in the plane. Seats: This was the worst part. The seats are not truly flat bed and just not comfy. It really felt like I was in a 1 star airline.  No free Internet in business class and after paying $15 I got very bad quality internet.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Budapest to Dubai. A regular traveler to Emirates, I was very disappointed, once again, by this company's sharply lower performance.  The welcome on the plane is expeditious, the smiles rare. We had two hostesses, one obviously beginner, shy to the point of not being able to look in the eyes while talking to us, and faster than lightning: the tablecloths are literally thrown on the shelves, the drinks served without presentation, she ran most of the time like most hostesses. The dishes had little flavor. Only positive points: the quality of the wines, including Champagne and the plate of cheese. The device ""wifi"" control of audiovisual instruments did not work, despite the repair efforts of a hostess much more experienced, pleasant and smiling, that we saw that during the claim. The limousine service promised in the price of the ticket is non-existent in Phuket, for reasons never explained, and the car provided to Dubai was the worst, dented on its flank must, while we have well reminded the hostess of the counter. we were theoretically entitled to two cars, having two separate tickets. It will be I hope our last experience with Emirates, happily competing on the same lines.  FR:  Voyageur habitué de la compagnie EMIRATES, j’ai été très déçu, une fois de plus, par les prestations en nette baisse, de cette compagnie. Dès l’embarquement – assuré à Phuket par des employés de la THAI AIRWAYS – on est traité comme des animaux, pas de sourire en vue. L’accueil dans l’avion est expéditif, les sourires rares. Nous avons eu deux hôtesses, l’une visiblement débutante, timide au point de ne pouvoir nous regarder dans les yeux en nous parlant, et plus rapide que l’éclair : les nappes sont littéralement jetées sur les tablettes, les boissons servies sans présentation, elle courait la plupart du temps comme la plupart des hôtesses. Les mets n’avaient que peu de saveur. Seuls points positifs : la qualité des vins, Champagne compris et l’assiette de fromage. Le dispositif «  wifi » de commande des instruments audiovisuels ne fonctionnait pas, malgré les efforts de réparation d’un hôtesse nettement plus expérimentée, agréable et souriante, que l’on a vu que lors de la réclamation. Le service de limousine promis dans le prix du billet est inexistant à Phuket, pour des raisons jamais expliquée, et la voiture fournie à Dubaï était la pire, cabossée sur son flanc doit, alors que nous avons bien rappelé à l’hôtesse du comptoir d’accueil que nous avions théoriquement droit à deux voitures, ayant deux billets séparés.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Vienna to Cape Town via Dubai. This review is about my outbound flight to Cape Town (December 19th 2018). My children and I were denied boarding our flight to South Africa due to not having their birth certificates upon check-in, even though the South African government updated the policy December 1st 2018 (which no longer requires this document as mandatory). Not only did Emirate not indicate at any time during the booking process about this law they refused to reason when I showed them South African's government recent update. Due to the busy Christmas season, we were unable to fly to South African until 3 days later, missed the cruise we were to join and had to embark the ship in Namibia 6 days after the original travel date. We were meant to meet my husband on board the ship and missed out on Christmas because of this mistake. The kids were devastated. We were over EUR€4,500 out of pocket since I had to book hotels, new flights and transfers, all because they hadn't updated their policies. Their customer service department is a joke as the only way I could submit a complaint was through their website online form. Their response (claiming zero responsibility and therefore denying me any compensation) was from a ""no-reply"" email address. Even after I spoke with a customer service rep over the phone I was instructed to submit a new complaint since I couldn't follow up to their response email. I submitted a new complaint, correcting their false claims (that I didn't have a travel letter from my husband, which I did have) and I haven't heard back. My husband and I have been working in the travel & hospitality industry for 25+ years and I am extremely knowledgable in luxury customer service; this is what I do for a living.

People’s seats didn’t work properly, my TV was broken, and the bar area looked terrible.

"✅ Trip Verified | Dubai to Bahrain. So we all know that economy gets you from A to B, safely and we are not expecting much especially with a short hop like this, only a one hour flight. Paid for a extra room seat at Door 3, 24 D being an aisle on the B777. Flight was very full with many children and to their credit two of the crew were very engaging with them and their parents. What I do not get is why Emirates insist on placing ten across high density on all their B777 aircraft - an industry norm these days but it begs belief. As the crew went up and down the aisle I was knocked into over 12 times in less than an hour and I am 78 Kg, some at least had the courtesy to apologize, most did not bother. I get its cattle class but I for one would never set foot on these aircraft in this high density. I find EK crew to be stoic, tired looking, the crew member at my door crew seat looked as if he dying for his bed, head in his hands, yawned non stop and a lot of the crew looked plain disinterested. This is obviously down to crew planning being over stretched. Overall ok, flight deck did a great job with announcements and the flight itself and landing was excellent - true skill.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled from Manchester to Faisalabad vi. Dubai, and from Manchester to Dubai the service was good. But from Dubai to Faisalabad, Emirates use the service provided by Flydubai, whose service is of a very poor quality. When providing a 'meal' it was just a small snack and when I asked about a hot drink such as a cup of tea, I was told to pay 20 dirhams (roughly £4.21 each), and soft drinks were roughly 5 dirhams (£1.05). I had 3 family members travelling with me (including my elderly parents), we paid over £2000 for tickets alone, and on top of that we were asked for outrageous prices for a service which should be covered by the ticket prices anyway. I contacted Emirates to complain and the email I received in reply was written in a way as though I were at fault, stating things such as ""this is the service we will contnue to provide"" and that I should contact my agent as they should have told me about these extra charges. However, on their booking it says 'meal provided' on both Emirates service and flydubai's service which would suggest that a reasonable meal is given, when in fact it was simply a small snack. A few days later a friend of mine returned from Faisalabad and Emirates were using the same service and the flight was delayed causing the airline to provide a hotel room. The shocking thing was he was told he would have to share a hotel room with complete strangers. No company has a right to do this as it is an invasion of privacy and is extremely invasive.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to Cape Town via Dubai. As a very frequent emirates passenger in the past, we have nor used the economy Emirates product for over 4 years. Check in was laborious as a they were checking everyone’s visas which is understandable. Boarding was good. No issues both in AMS or DXB. Onboard service is now a huge let down. On both sectors after take off it took 2 hours before the food service was started. And at no point was a bar service offered. Not just alcohol beverages but water or soft drinks. The food was below average and it was only after the food was eaten the bar service came out. I can on Y assume that Emirates is trying to cut back and save money. But what they don’t realise is the majority of there traffic is in Economy and if you keep cutting the service then people will stop booking. Especially when the completion like Qatar or Etihad offer better service on the same routes. We will not be booking with Emirates economy in the near future as it is not a pleasurable experience anymore. Also I felt the ICE was of a reduced choice as compared to a few years ago.

✅ Trip Verified |  Madrid to Sydney via Dubai. This is a review that is a follow up on my outbound. The reviews are almost identical. Great hard product but the soft product on Emirates is just simply lacking and its down to the crews who are at best very lackadaisical. You have a few who are superb but on the whole it reflects a training problem. Much noise and chat going on which is very annoying during the night routes. One thing I have never seen and clearly much revelry goes on in the Emirates dorms. One female FA groped the boob of another in a playful manner. Now for red hot blooded males this may be fine but sorry this is a major flag carrier. Whilst on the Emirates gripe. The IFE is fine but to be honest was struggling too find some films that really appealed. Emirates caters for a huge language base. Final gripe. The seat quality certainly in economy is dire. The cushioning is hard or maybe has been so well used that it is worn. Come on Emirates.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Madrid via Dubai. Being a Qantas FF I occasionally travel on Emirates but with a Qantas code on it. Now same aircraft (A380) but the whole experience is totally different. Have been on Emirates a few times a year mostly when routing to a Europe port other than London. Sydney being the Qantas home base is these days very efficient to get through. Self check in (even though i can use the First counter) and through security and to the Qantas lounge in probably 15 minutes. The Emirates version is very different and rightly so as it is not home base. The economy line up was massive. Fortunately could use the premium line and was through swiftly. Time for Emirates to start using self check in. Used the superb Qantas First Lounge and then moved over to the Emirates lounge which was a very pleasant place. From there the whole experience was pretty dismal. Had a whole row to myself in the main cabin which was great. Same sights and sounds as for the Qantas A380 but its the customer service that lets Emirates down. They just simply have recruited too many young kids who just dont have the professionalism or charm of the slightly older crews on Qantas main line. Its really a training problem. Having crew that speak 30 languages on board is fine but does not help if their manner is to put it mildly rather brusque. Charm school is sorely missing. Mid flight snacks are poor to non existent. Food is a little underwhelming. Delayed start from Sydney due to bad weather and a tight connection meant a run through Dubai T3 to get to the Madrid flight. Same plane, different crew but same lack of charm and professionalism. And Emirates...one other thing. Please do not have your crews take away blankets, act as general cleaners and so on around 30 minutes before landing. It jut is not a great look. Overall the airline needs to employ proper training methods or better still get some older crew who can teach the young ones how to. The fact is that Emirates gets away with sloppy standards since they have a great network, hard product in the A380, great airport in Dubai. For me it is the easiest way to get to Madrid from Sydney so have to get used to a substandard level of service which many people have commented on. I would recommend Emirates only as it has the route network and schedules.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to my business trip I had to travel from Copenhagen Kastrup airport to Dubai and then back to Warsaw to catch my next flight from there. So first part of trip was operated by A380. During Online process I realized there is no more windows seats available. During checkin on the airport I've asked to window seat and I got this seat in emergency row. Also my baggage has been sent without extra costs (I had extra 6kg). At the terminal I've paid to lounge contracted with Emirates airline but it wasn't worth this price (250 DKK, around 33EUR). Boarding at the gate was late around 30 minutes but during this process there was good order, people was queued in the groups. Service on board was good but nothing special comparing to other airlines, meal choice was poor (only dishes with rice). Very good and very stable entertainment system with big selection of movies and games. Also GSM and WIFI network available onboard (I didn't use them at all due to nice passengers travelling next to me, we talked all the time). I land around midnight so traffic wasn't big and all security and luggage pickup in Dubai takes not much (around 1 hour). My flight back to Warsaw was 2 two days later at 8:05. I tried to check-in to choose my seat but it wasn't possible. During my way to the airport I've got an SMS with info I had been seated in the middle. So I went to the airport around 3:30AM and very quickly drop my luggage and pass all security to avoid waiting. It wasn't possible to change my seat, however they seat me in emergency row again. Unfortunately I had been charged for an extra 6 kilos in luggage. Security control was terrible long, they try to find something in my bag but they didn't tell me what they are looking for. I was more clever than on my previous flight and I've put all my cables in checked luggage before to avoid cables confiscated like on my previous flight. I don't understand why ethernet cable is dangerous at Dubai airport but it's ok on all other airports around the world. Inside the airport I found hundreds of people seating and lying on the floor and making passing very difficult in some areas. Whole airport was looking like dormitory for the homeless. Wifi I found overloaded, there was many disconnections during my use. During boarding there was a big mess, airport staff didn't queue people in groups before they start, boarding started 15 minutes after scheduled time. Flight was operated by Boeing 777 and I found seats are more tight than in A380. This travel was terribly uncomfortable.

The air crew could not care less; there was just an announcement on board that the in-flight entertainment for some passengers cannot be re-started. Two attempts to get the attention of the air stewardesses through the help button for a separate matter were ignored and not responded to at all.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Malta to Male via Dubai. Complaint related to irresponsible staff and left without food for the flight from Malta to Male. I suffer from severe celiac condition and I am intolerant for any type of wheat and contamination. My father who booked the flights did not know that he had to book Gluten free meals 48 hours in advance, when we arrived at the airport in Malta, we asked at the check-in counter about gluten free meals and they informed us that the only way to get gluten free meals on board was to reserve the meals 48 hours in advance. We discussed with the inflight staff and asked them if they can spare some meat from the business class meals and the flight attended said that that was not possible. When we landed in Cyprus we asked to talk to the flight purser and she said she will see what she can do, Once we left Larnaka-Cyprus to Dubai, we asked if the crew managed to solve the issue, but they said unfortunately not and there was nothing they can do, they said that they informed Dubai so they can prepare food for the next flight, again I was left hungry on the flight between Larnaka-Cyprus and Dubai. My Father offered to pay extra for the business class food, but the staff said no. When we landed in Dubai, the first thing we done was to go to customer help and information desk and asked if the crew have ordered any Gluten free food for the next flight from Dubai to Male, the desk assistant said that there was nothing on the system and she will try and get some gluten free food on-board the next flight but she said she cannot promise.  We boarded the flight from Dubai to Male to Maldives and when dinner time arrived they informed us that there was no Gluten free meals and that there was only 3 meals available for other guests which they pre-ordered.",2,2019-01-06,Malta,True,malta male via dubai complaint related irresponsible staff left without food flight malta male suffer severe celiac condition intolerant type wheat contamination father booked flight know book gluten free meal hour advance arrived airport malta asked check counter gluten free meal informed u way get gluten free meal board reserve meal hour advance discussed inflight staff asked spare meat business class meal flight attended said possible landed cyprus asked talk flight purser said see left larnaka cyprus dubai asked crew managed solve issue said unfortunately nothing said informed dubai prepare food next flight left hungry flight larnaka cyprus dubai father offered pay extra business class food staff said landed dubai first thing done go customer help information desk asked crew ordered gluten free food next flight dubai male desk assistant said nothing system try get gluten free food board next flight said cannot promise boarded flight dubai male maldives dinner time arrived informed u gluten free meal meal available guest pre ordered

"Not Verified |  Sydney to Athens via Dubai. My husband and I have flown to Europe previously with Etihad, Qatar, and this year, Emirates. To say Emirates was disappointing and a league behind Etihad and Qatar would be an understatement. Our itinerary was to fly to Athens with Emirates, stay a night in Athens and then fly to Santorini with a different airline the following morning. Upon bag drop in Sydney with Emirates, we were asked if we would like our bags checked all the way through to Santorini. We stated that we had a night in Athens and were flying a different airline to Santorini; however, were reassured that this wasn't a problem at all and we could easily check our bags all the way through. So, for ease, time and convenience, we did; as we trusted that Emirates knew what they were doing. However, upon check in at Athens airport for our flight to Santorini, we were told by our airline that our bags would not have been checked through and we had to go and find them at baggage claim. With baggage claim struggling to locate our bags at baggage claim, we ended up missing our 9am flight to Santorini. As a direct result of us missing the flight, we then had to pay 450 euro for new flights to Santorini (one way for two people ; an equivalent of over $800 AUD), with the new flight scheduled for 5pm. As a direct result of Emirates incompetence, we not only missed our flight, but missed an entire day in Santorini. The anxiety caused from not knowing where our bags were, no one being able to help us, missing our flight, not being able to get onto another flight for another 8 hours, paying 450 euro for new flights, re-scheduling our hotel transfer and dinner booking (meaning that we could not get into the restaurant until 10pm) and having to re-purchase 40 euro train tickets back to Athens caused me to have an anxiety attack in the airport.  The most disappointing part is that Emirates were so difficult to deal with after the incident. We had to wait months to hear back from Emirates if our new flights to Santorini would be paid for; and that was the only compensation they gave. Emirates would not pay for any of my medical bills, our new train tickets or any compensation for our flights to/from Europe despite them causing havoc to our trip. As a result, I would strongly urge people not to fly with Emirates due to their level of incompetence, lack of professionalism and lack of empathy.",2,2018-12-22,Australia,False,verified sydney athens via dubai husband flown europe previously etihad qatar year emirate say emirate disappointing league behind etihad qatar would understatement itinerary fly athens emirate stay night athens fly santorini different airline following morning upon bag drop sydney emirate asked would like bag checked way santorini stated night athens flying different airline santorini however reassured problem could easily check bag way ease time convenience trusted emirate knew however upon check athens airport flight santorini told airline bag would checked go find baggage claim baggage claim struggling locate bag baggage claim ended missing flight santorini direct result u missing flight pay euro new flight santorini one way two people equivalent aud new flight scheduled pm direct result emirate incompetence missed flight missed entire day santorini anxiety caused knowing bag one able help u missing flight able get onto another flight another hour paying euro new flight scheduling hotel transfer dinner booking meaning could get restaurant pm purchase euro train ticket back athens caused anxiety attack airport disappointing part emirate difficult deal incident wait month hear back emirate new flight santorini would paid compensation gave emirate would pay medical bill new train ticket compensation flight europe despite causing havoc trip result would strongly urge people fly emirate due level incompetence lack professionalism lack empathy
"✅ Trip Verified |  Barcelona to Jakarta via Dubai. Emirates online and ground services got it wrong all the way. Going from Barcelona to Jakarta we had planned a stopover in Dubai, we had an hotel for the night and the second flight the day after. So we could travel in eco without being too tired. Unfortunately for us Emirates messed up multiple times. The flight was delayed, that might be a normal safety measure. But then we got no information or wrong information all the way. It’s a wrong strategy to do so with Emirates, as they can mess up your trip fully, and won’t give you more than a poor meal (free poor meal). They can tell you that you will get refunded for your additional expenses and then decline later. All the way to Jakarta, we asked to sleep in Dubai, in Emirates lounge maybe? Explaining we were losing our hotel. The day of departure, after delay notification: Support chat: “I don’t know”. Emirates Barcelona ground service: “I can’t give you anything in Dubai, you should ask there. But you will get the 600 euros indemnity each for severe delay, it should cover all your expenses, in case anyway.""  At Emirates Dubai ground service: “Hi, can we sleep somewhere? We are really tired? - Here is your meal voucher. - But we would like to sleep, we are tired, we are not hungry, really. Can we go to the lounge, maybe? - Yeah.. maybe, try there, here is your meal voucher”. We needed to sleep, we paid the hotel in the airport, around 200 USD. We do the online complaint to Emirates. Emirates feedback: “In accordance with the EC regulation 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union, you are entitled to EUR 600.00 (Euros Six Hundred only) each.” We fill the form for funds transfer, as requested 7.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled with my family from Dubai to Mauritius and what I did not like was the conduct of the staff near the end of the flight. The flight attendant came and collected the blankets 45 minutes before the landing and she did that in a firm way, like there was no discussion. I gave her mine (even though I am very cold whenever an AC is on) and had to ask her to let my daughter keep it. She said yes in a way like she was doing a favour to me. Then the lady next seat told her that she needed to keep the blanket, because she was sick and the flight attendant had a back and forth with her until she conceded at the end. Then after that, she came for the headphones 35 minutes before the landing with an almost rude attitude. My daughter and I were nearly finishing our movie and wanted to tell her that, but then I was watching around and no one was saying anything - I felt like I would be the only one complaining. I gave her both headphones and sat there for 30 minutes thinking about this flight. After all, leaving a blanket and a headphone for the passenger until the end of the flight is not asking too much.

"Not Verified |  Munich to Adelaide via Dubai. The first flight from Munich to Dubai was excellent. Traveling alone with my 10 month old son, the cabin crew were amazing. Introduced themselves personally and took my son for walks through the plane, gave him a meal & toys, and took a Polaroid keepsake. The flight wasnt full so I had the 4 seats to myself with the bassinet and when someone moved to the aisle seat after takeoff, Natasha said she would find the passenger an alternative seat for both our comfort levels (which was unnecessary but great). Unfortunately, the Dubai-Adelaide leg was terrible. I waited nearly 1.5 hours after takeoff to get the bassinet put up, then during the flight which was really turbulent (not much can be done about that I know), I had to buzz for my food trays to be removed as they sat there for a few hours. An elderly man was I'll in the toilet near where I was seated, and had opened the door whilst doubled over the sink vomiting, so again I buzzed for assistance for him but nobody even came! 2 female crew had an argument in the aisle about 1 getting a food order wrong, and it was just very unprofessional. Had it not been for the assistance of the passenger on the aisle and behind me helping me to reach the overhead compartment etc as i needed nappies and things during the flight, but had my son in my arms for almost 10 of the 12 hours due to the turbulence so was attempting to function using 1 hand, the flight would have been a worse experience.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Hamburg to Dubai. It was an excellent flight. My comfort was helped by the fact that the gentleman in front did not lean back and that the seat left of me (I had an aisle in the middle row) was empty. So I could spread out my stuff. About 30 min after take off I walked to the galley and asked whether the bar was already open. I received a smile and two glasses of white wine. 15 Min later they distributed food and beverages, where the beverage trolley followed close to the food trolley. Crew worked with a smile. Beverages and food were good for an economy meal, wines were even good.  Throughout the flight crew passed by and served beverages. The IFE was high class and the internet was poor as usual.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Nairobi via Dubai. My husband and I flew with Emirates for the first time and had negative experiences on both flights, there and back. The negative was in Dubai when we were waiting for our second flight. We were told boarding would start 40 minutes before departure and would close 20 minutes before departure. Approximately 50 minutes before departure was the first time the flight was shown on the departure screen with ""FINAL CALL"". We had to run to get to the gate on time as we thought we would miss our flight. When we arrived I asked why they started boarding so early and why there was no announcement for boarding until ""FINAL CALL"" and the hostess replied ""It's protocol"". We received no explicit reason or justification whatsoever. The second was in Nairobi. Their system was down which is understandable that queues were extremely long and service taking a long time as well. However, we received absolutely no announcements as to what was happening and when the flight would take off. We were meant to fly at 10:45pm. After boarding at approximately that time we sat on the plane at the gate for 3 hours until we finally took off at 1:45am the next morning. On that flight I pushed the service button for water as we weren't given anything for those 3 hours waiting on the plane but no one answered my request. I did this twice until I gave up. This wait and level of service was extremely frustrating to most passengers as they had connecting flights with short layovers.

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Brisbane via Dubai. Our flight from London Heathrow was late, which resulted in us rushing through the transit to book in for the next connecting flight from Dubai to Brisbane (via Singapore). When we arrived at the Dubai check in, it was apparent that there was something wrong but the Emirates staff just talked amongst themselves. After some 15 or 20 other passengers checked in after us for the same flight (5 of them Business Class customers) the Emirates staff told us that they had changed our seats and we couldn't sit together, but they offered no reason for this, I told the staff that we had booked these seats and my partner was a nervous flyer so we could not sit in separate locations. They said you have no choice, I asked to be upgraded to 1st class, they refused, I offered to travel on the next flight 02.30hrs (some 5 hours later), I was abruptly told that our luggage was on the flight that we were originally booked on (21.15hrs) and we needed to board that flight as it was departing in a few minutes. Their attitude for Business Class customers (or any customer) was deplorable. We arrived at Brisbane, but our luggage didn't, the staff at Brisbane were helpful but couldn't tell us where it was, as it hadn't been 'scanned in' at Dubai. I then got access to text messages on my mobile phone, which I couldn't obtain whilst on the flights, for some reason, the text read 'due to operational reasons we have had to transfer you to the flight that departs from Dubai at 02.30hrs', why didn't the staff at Dubai know about this instead of refusing me travel on this service, especially when I had offered to do just that. We waited at Brisbane, for the next flight to arrive, but still no luggage. It took Emirates 3 days to get our luggage to us, by this time we had travelled to Cairns as this was how we had booked our holiday and accommodation. On our return flight to London, which departed from Melbourne, we checked in and the staff said 'due to the flight being full we have changed your seats', from Dubai to London. I couldn't understand why this would be necessary just because the flight was full, again I refused this and asked to be upgraded, no was the reply. We then had to wait at the customer service desk and they eventually explained that they had e mailed Dubai and we had got our original seats, although the staff pointed out to me that the seats were only a request and not guaranteed, I showed them an email from Emirates which confirmed the flight and seat details, from the outset of the booking. The Emirates customer service desk operative made a point that she had done us a favour, in getting our original seats back. When we arrived at Dubai check in, again we were faced with 'we have changed your seats'. I couldn't believe this and again had to wait and argue to get our original seats. The staff on the plane were very attentive and polite on all legs, but the staff on the ground just don't care, rude and not worthy of the Emirates uniform. I asked several times 'how much do you want me to pay before you start giving us some level of service' I have written to Emirates with the complaint and incredibly they have referred it to Qantas, because Emirates were only operating the flight on their behalf, how that works when it was the Emirates staff who caused the issues I don't know.",2,2018-12-11,United Kingdom,True,london brisbane via dubai flight london heathrow late resulted u rushing transit book next connecting flight dubai brisbane via singapore arrived dubai check apparent something wrong emirate staff talked amongst passenger checked u flight business class customer emirate staff told u changed seat sit together offered reason told staff booked seat partner nervous flyer could sit separate location said choice asked upgraded st class refused offered travel next flight hr hour later abruptly told luggage flight originally booked hr needed board flight departing minute attitude business class customer customer deplorable arrived brisbane luggage staff brisbane helpful tell u scanned dubai got access text message mobile phone obtain whilst flight reason text read due operational reason transfer flight departs dubai hr staff dubai know instead refusing travel service especially offered waited brisbane next flight arrive still luggage took emirate day get luggage u time travelled cairn booked holiday accommodation return flight london departed melbourne checked staff said due flight full changed seat dubai london understand would necessary flight full refused asked upgraded reply wait customer service desk eventually explained e mailed dubai got original seat although staff pointed seat request guaranteed showed email emirate confirmed flight seat detail outset booking emirate customer service desk operative made point done u favour getting original seat back arrived dubai check faced changed seat believe wait argue get original seat staff plane attentive polite leg staff ground care rude worthy emirate uniform asked several time much want pay start giving u level service written emirate complaint incredibly referred qantas emirate operating flight behalf work emirate staff caused issue know
"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Dubai. For the third time in a row, Emirates served only chicken meal to me on their flight. Their general excuse is ""Sorry sir but we ran out of beef"". This was my third flight in 2 months where I got the same reply. First I thought it was just my bad luck being related to the seat I have chosen. But I always pay extra for my seat selection and this time I had chosen the front section of the plane.

"✅ Trip Verified | Manchester to Singapore via Dubai. We flew Emirates on each leg of our trip to Singapore. The first leg on Sunday 25th November 2018 (Manchester -Dubai) was excellent, the crew were attentive and very pleasant. The next leg (Dubai-Singapore) was less pleasant the crew less attentive. The return flights (8th December)were much more unpleasant the aircraft was full on both legs but that should not have had any bearing on the complete lack of interest that the crew displayed. On the first leg my wife felt as though she was about to vomit, I went with her to the back of the plane and asked a member of the crew for some advice (He was chatting to two other crew members at the time) his response was to point to a toilet at the rear and said “Sick bags in the restroom” no other concern was expressed. The leg from Dubai to Manchester was over night leaving Dubai at 2.55am for at least three hours we saw no crew at all, anything we needed had to be requested by a visit to the curtained off galley. Overall we were extremely disappointed by the standard of service, far less than we expected. The uniforms of the crew are probably the smartest in the business but along with this must go an equivalent level of customer service. This was our first trip with Emirates but I expected far more from them than this. Good clean aircraft, food only so-so, good timekeeping but oh dear!

Instead we could have 3 seats to ourselves, how kind seeing the airplane was half full. It would have been interesting to see what would have happened if it was full. All this was because the plane had changed, it was still and A380 guys. Seats all in the same place! I’m not happy and seriously considering using a different airline from now on.

Almost 6 months later with over 8 attempts to contact company to see if they would be able to listen to our concerns and issues we experienced - nothing.

Being a night flight, the Emirates staff not only failed to request them to tone down in consideration to other passengers. But what shocked most passengers is to see one of the Emirates staff is part of the noise making throughout the flight with the 3 men. Seated herself at the crew exit seat facing them. Extremely unprofessional for any staff to act in this manner by disregarding passengers comfort. Next, the food was poorly presented. Budget airlines like AirAsia has better food.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to London via Dubai. Having a stopover at Dubai now enroute to London. Decided to check on why Emirates was below expectation. Initially wanted to keep my experience to myself but not after reading Skytrax reviews on Emirates. First and foremost, I was allotted the worst seat anyone can get. Seat 66H,  the lavatory seat. Wrote to Emirates 3 days back, I am in Dubai now, my flight is done, but no response from them. Luckily upon online check-in, I decided to change my ""aromatic"" seat - and I had to pay extra for a different seat. Emirates should not sell or make money from this row of seats. Esp when there are still empty seats on the flight for sale or seat change for extra payment. Its downright unacceptable and disgusting from a country that prides itself to be super rich operating the 2nd largest A380 fleet. I know now, I was fooled by all of Emirates advertisements and their perceived image. On to the flight, the flight was below expectation. Economy class cabin crews' attention and attitude got heaps to improve. Giving me the immediate impression that Emirates only crave and care for Business and First Class passengers attention, I guess Economy class passengers are only herds of cattle to them. The food was bland and presentation was poor. And the Emirates A380 economy seat is very uncomfortable Someone should remind Emirates management, that Economy class service ultimately differentiates an airline from its competitors and generates the most revenue for any airline Anyone wants to fly Emirates? fly Business or First, never Economy.",5,2018-12-04,Singapore,True,kuala lumpur london via dubai stopover dubai enroute london decided check emirate expectation initially wanted keep experience reading skytrax review emirate first foremost allotted worst seat anyone get seat h lavatory seat wrote emirate day back dubai flight done response luckily upon online check decided change aromatic seat pay extra different seat emirate sell make money row seat esp still empty seat flight sale seat change extra payment downright unacceptable disgusting country pride super rich operating nd largest fleet know fooled emirate advertisement perceived image flight flight expectation economy class cabin crew attention attitude got heap improve giving immediate impression emirate crave care business first class passenger attention guess economy class passenger herd cattle food bland presentation poor emirate economy seat uncomfortable someone remind emirate management economy class service ultimately differentiates airline competitor generates revenue airline anyone want fly emirate fly business first never economy

"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Athens. When we received the email from Emirates to check in we were offered an upgrade to Business for $600 per person.  We took it, thinking that we would be wowed by Emirates world class service, food and reputation. Read on. After checking in online we called to find out more about Emirates' car service, knowing we were outside the 50 mile radius we were willing to pay the difference. ""No' we were told, ""you booked the super saver upgrade, so you are not eligible"". Really? Even if we would pay for it? After we checked in at the airport we asked where the lounge was located. ""No"" we were told ""you booked the super saver upgrade, so that doesn't get lounge access"". Funny, didn't see mention of that when Emirates took my $1200. (we got into the lounge any way). Boarded an old 777-200. It was late (almost midnight). We had a nice cocktail and dinner and went to sleep. Forgot to put the sticker on my shirt and so 2 hours before landing, and in the middle of a nice deep sleep, was awoken by the FA who asked what I wanted for breakfast (even though he could see I was sound asleep). My husband was out like a light and the FA said ""I guess he doesn't want breakfast"". Astute observation. Before I went to sleep and after I woke up I tried to find something to watch on the IFE. Nothing. It was late so there was no question that we would be sleeping, but the seat was not full flat and the hard arm rests were hard to maneuver around.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Houston. I have never experienced such a complete & total lack of professionalism, by any airline. Travelers can encounter a problem on any airline, but it is how an airline handles a problem that is most important. This experience on EK was a ""case study in abject incompetence"". The flight was boarded on time, but departure time came & went, & passengers were left sitting, with zero flight deck contact for almost 1.5 hours before the 1st contact by The Captain. There had been a problem with a smoke detector in the crew's sleeping cabin, but it would soon be fixed & we would be ""on our way in about 15 minutes"". Yet again, we sat with no update k for over another hour, by which time the flight was 2.5 hours late. The Captain then made a 2nd announcement that it had taken longer to fix the problem than anticipated, but we would ""now depart in about 10-15 minutes"". However, for a 3rd time, passengers were left sitting another 1+ hour with no flight deck contact. What kind of flight crew training does EK provide, where a Captain thinks it is OK to let passengers sit in silence on a flight delayed 3+ hours, yet make only 2 incorrect announcements? After sitting for 3.5 hours the Captain direct all passengers to collect their belongings & deplane. So 100's of passengers deplane, but those in 1st & Business Class on the upper deck had another surprise waiting. Neither the Captain, or the flight crew had alerted ground staff that upper deck passengers had been directed to deplane. As a result, all 1st & Business Class passengers were crammed at the end of the jetway in front of the 2nd floor elevators, with no place to go! Passengers could enter the elevators, but security had disabled the floor selection buttons after the plane had originally boarded. Passengers started to bang on the glass walls to try & get the attention of security staff who could be seen in the distance, but unable to hear through the heavy glass walls. Passengers finally returned to the plane to tell the ""totally clueless"" flight crew, there was no place to go & passengers were trapped in the small  2nd floor area. Security personnel finally noticed passengers banging on the wall & 1 unlocked a 5th floor door & came to the 2nd level via stairwell, since they also could not operate the elevators. This employee then directed all 1st & Business Class passengers to carry all their belongings up 6 flights to the 5th floor Business Class Lounge! What a fiasco of total incompetence. The flight ended up being 5.5 hours late, but once airborne, passengers quickly learned that even though the plane had sat at the gate for almost 6 hours, it had not been re-catered, so the flight was serving a ""breakfast"" menu, even though the flight departed at almost 4:00PM. No dinner would be served, but rather a light snack, since the menu was still for the ""original"" flight times.

"✅ Trip Verified | I traveled from Trivandrum to Dallas via Dubai to visit my 94 year old dad who was in critical condition in the hospital. However, he passed away the night before my flight.

Odessa to Hanoi via Dubai. I had a very bad experience with Emirates. On 3rd July, 2018 my wife and I took a return flight from Odessa (ODS) to Hanoi ((HAN) via Dubai (DXB); After checked-in, We have waited in long time over boarding time, and then a lady likes a Representative of EK appeared and made a contact with passengers in lounge to announce that flight was delayed more. And in long time waiting that lady appeared again to notice that the incoming flight from DXB landed in Kishinev (Moldova)- KIV and then flew back at ODS in a couple time. We and passengers on this flight have continued to wait. Nearly 02 hours later the lady informed that the incoming flight would flight back to ODS, but crews were over duty time then there would be no outgoing flight to DXB from ODS, it means flight today cancelled. The alternative flight ODS-DXB would be on next day morning, but she didn’t know when! How should I do when I was sure that We missed connecting flight from DXB to HAN? I showed our tickets, mentioned her that our connection flight to Hanoi and asked her what solution would be done for us. I received an answer from her: “I cannot do anything here because there is no computer, no system. I have only telephone!” Even She didn't care on my connection ticket. And she informed that Passenger were provided meals and hotel for that night and would take flight on next day but she didn’t know when! Emirates representative at ODS airport didn’t offer me any alternative protected trip except meals an hotel for that night! No answer, no choice offered by Emirates for me. It’s was terrible and truly that Emirates have set own passengers like me and my wife aside and had no care. Fortunately, there was an flight from ODS to HAN later at 09:30PM by Turkish airlines on the same day. I requested Emirates representative to make endorsement to TK, but She replied that she couldn’t do it. I requested her make a confirmation letter about EK flight cancellation to get refund later.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Madrid to Male via Dubai. I have never flown Emirates until last October 27 in a holiday trip with my wife to Maldives. Madrid to Male was nothing special: economy seats have average pitch, ICE system works fine and movies selection is huge apparently. Service onboard was quite bad, food was average, flight attendants were rude, the purser spent the whole flight shouting at the crew. They never asked if we wanted more bread or more cafe etc. The flight from Dubai to Male was scheduled at 3:15 am, so we wanted nothing but sleep. Even if we put on all of our ""resting stuff"" the flight crew woke up us at 5 am for breakfast. She said that she must assure that everyone on board was offered breakfast. On our return flights we found another surprise. As the travel agency gave us the booking reference two months ago I purchased the seats, as the fare the agency took did not allow to choose seats. I paid 140€ for the seats. So far so good until we checked in at Male airport. Our seats were changed with no reason. In both flights (MLE-DXB and DXB-MAD). The handling staff could not tell me any reasonable reason, and the finished with a great ""ask Emirates staff when you arrive to Dubai"". Great answer from a professional employee. But when I tried to get an explanation at Dubai my luck did not get better: after twenty minutes trying to hold a conversation, one person who supposedly was in charge gave me a piece of paper with a web site written and told me to fill an online claim. Great airline, great staff, great service. Onboard more of the same: bad service, rude crew, poor food and added to my other trip: my entertainment system did not work.

There were many, many children and some would not stop crying. The few bathrooms became dirty fast and stayed that way through the flight. Finally, the food was mediocre at the best.

The result, impersonal service when there was the luxury of time to do much better. Several requests for drinks etc were misunderstood, because it seemed that the crew were making incorrect assumptions about what I wanted, instead of taking the time to ask and listen!

Perth to London via Dubai. My husband and I have been flying with Emirates to London from Perth for many years and had never encountered a problem before, until our latest flight to London, we had a 2 3hour delay. You prepare for you’re flight only to have to return home did not experience good management in Perth about what to do. We were given Taxi fare to get home but the queue was very unorganised - some were getting hotels others cabs but were not directed.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I was travelling Emirates from Stansted to Hong Kong via Dubai, this is the first time I filed with Emirates as I live close to Stansted airport and this is the only route from Stansted to Hong Kong.  I was disappointed by my  experience. When I booked the ticket thru my travel agent, my seat is always classified as Confirmed as seen by online tracking. So to my very surprise, when I got to the Stansted Airport check in counter 3 hours before my flight departure, the staff at the check in counter told me that I was actually a “stand by” passenger from Dubai to Hong Kong which they could not actually check me in and print my boarding pass, they said I could only confirm my seat when I arrive Dubai and they could do nothing in Stansted. I said to them that my seat status is always written as Confirmed on online tracking and I could not accept such an uncertainty only to find out if I will get a seat to Hong Kong when I arrive Dubai. The staff only explained because the plane was overbooked and I was chosen (randomly?). I had flown numerous airlines in my life,  but such thing was never happened, but only with Emirates! Even though with my insistence, the issue was solved and I got a seat at Stansted, this incident already left me a bad impression about this airline.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Barcelona to Dubai. A cabin crew damaged my belongings.  Just before the captain commenced descent, against my advice, staff shoved and crushed several of my airport purchases into a almost full overhead compartment above me, in my full view. Prior to this, I'd request twice for assistance to find a suitable space, not the one above me, but my request was totally ignored. Upon landing for disembarkment, I approached the cabin crew supervisor and showed him the damages done on my purchases by one of his crew. He expressed his apologies and advised I write in to Emirates as there nothing other than apologies he can offer. He was also shown the almost-full state of the compartment directly above us where the packagings were crushed and damaged. I wrote to Emirates and below is their ""not my problem"" template reply from Customer Service Thank you for your correspondence of 03 October 2018 regarding Emirates flight EK 186 from Barcelona to Dubai on 29 September. I regret to learn that you found your biscuit box dented on the above flight. However, I am required to highlight that personal belongings brought onboard are the responsibility of each individual passenger, and the airline cannot accept responsibility for loss of, or damage to, personal items. According to our records, as you were sitting in the bulkhead row, you were advised that all bags and loose items have to be stowed for landing in the overhead lockers. It is my understanding that you did not inform the cabin crew that your bags contained fragile items. Notwithstanding the above, we certainly appreciate you bringing your experience to our attention, and I wish to assure you that your comments, along with the Cabin Supervisor's report, have been shared with the departments concerned. This enables them to take appropriate internal action to improve the standard of service offered to our customers. I can also advise that the cabin crew operating in Economy class on this flight have received guidance in this regard. Please accept my apologies for not having met your expectations on this occasion. I hope that we can leave you with a more positive impression on your future flights with us.

A chauffeur was booked to pick me and my daughter up and we had a hotel room booked complimentary from Emirates. When we arrived in Dubai, no one from Emirates helped me to find my chauffeur. I went to the Emirates counter and the person who was really unhelpful, cancelled my booking without asking me anything and was very rude! I had to wait for hours at the airport with my 17 months daughter. I was expecting much more from the business class from Emirates. The cabin crew during the flights was average. While my daughter was sleeping I asked one one of the crew to look after her while I was in the bathroom. She showed me that she was really annoyed to help me, she finally decided to stay as I asked her if I could get someone else to help me if she didn't want to do it. The cabin crew was eating food in front of clients and was not in a hurry to help clients.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Johannesburg. Emirates is a joke. We were given a ""E"" and ""F"" seats at check in, on a horribly tight 3-4-3 configuration. We asked if we could be given a window or aisle seat but was refused. The check in staff then called her supervisor and said ""Hi, I am calling as two passengers would like to change their seats. I want to call because I want to let them know I have put in my effort and you can just say a no so I can please them"". This is humiliating. On the flight, the seats were the tightest I have met in economy class. The highly rated ICE system was a joke - they claimed to have over 3000 hours of inflight entertainment but in fact, most movies were the unpopular or old ones. The so called free wifi allowed you for 10 minutes of messaging only.  The food is ok, but nothing to cry for. The crews were mostly impolite, and even for the polite ones, not proactive to help on anything. We had a tight connection (1 hour which we need to collect our bags and recheck again) and asked if we could be seated to the front of the aircraft for quick disembarkation.

"Not Verified |  I have flown with Emirates over several years but I won't be after my recent trip to the UK. On both legs (to Birmingham/return to Melbourne) the service left a lot to be desired after many years of excellent service. My wife who had asked for diabetic meals (in advance) had white rolls/sandwiches given to her - as was the diabetic passenger - next to her. They both explained to the staff that brown bread is what they had asked for as white bread is a no-no for those suffering with diabetes. Most of the other contents of the meals were not conducive with those with diabetes. The ""hot"" meals were late in there delivery on most occasions. There was obviously something wrong as staff members were arguing with one another saying who was at fault or wasn't. Either way, it wasn't very professional and disappointing for the customers to hear this going on - I was seating in the row in front of the cabin crew prepare the meals. I wouldn't have minded if it had only happened the once but it happened on our return flight. One has to ask why is moral so low with the Emirates air crew on Emirates these days?

"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Athens via Dubai. Emirates is an overpriced airline with too much marketing budget and no substance, one that I would advise others to never fly on unless they have no other options. The flight was bad, but not funny or interesting experience bad - just depressing and frustrating and not worth the money you pay for it. My food wasn't served until 6 hours into the flight (on my side of the aisle, the other side got served an hour or two earlier), attendants did not respond to the call button, and when they did serve you they did not speak, smile or even respond with a ""yes or no"" (when asked to bring water). Which was strange considering that had two shifts on board - so there was a lot of attendants wandering around, but none of them seemed to be working. The attendants ended up being more of a nuisance than service - because there were so many of them, they used the passenger's overhead bins in my area (4-5 bins, about 5 rows both sides) for their items and passengers were left with no space. In an attempt to hire as many nationalities as possible, the crew had no cohesion or chemistry - they split off into sub groups based on nationality/language and spent most of the flight gossiping and chatting with their friends. There was audible laughter when the screen popped up with a ""what did you think of this flight"", followed by several ""terrible"" from the rows in front and behind us. The in-flight entertainment system was dated and old; movies not modern and recent, and the Business Class lounge experience during the transfer in Dubai was atrocious and left a lot to be desired (again, on the service side of things). These are minor issues but the flight was so terrible that these other issues are amplified and made worse.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Cebu via Dubai. We booked through a travel agency which gave us separate bookings for every person. Online Check-in should be standard and Emirates offers it. However, the Website is hard to navigate and it takes ages to load. Then, two of us (two out of five) could not check in online. So we went to the airport and checked in the classic way. We were checking in four hours prior to departure. The first Check-in agent was really friendly, but unfortunately, she handed us over to a colleague who was rude. We tried to get seats near each other, she said no seats available.  There are hundreds of people in the queue behind us and you tell us they all have seats and you can't change it? They didn't all do the online check-in because there were seperate queues. So we don't get seats near each other, okay. We go to the gate and there is the next problem: There is a pre-boarding area. They had to get us out of there two hours before departure. It was a mess. There, they could suddenly magically change our seats. So ground service seems to be good or bad depending on your fortune. So the flight was normal. Legroom was okay but not outstanding. Recline of the seat wasn't working. The meal was great. IFE had a awesome choice, but unfortunately there was two minutes of ads before every film. When we arrived in DXB, we went to the costumer service to ask if we could get seats near each other since we were spread all over the plane. The staff was again rude and not motivated at all. She said she could not do anything for us. We got to the gate and picked up some free ice cream form Emirates (That was great, keep it up!) on the way. There was again this strange kind of first stage boarding. It was a mess. When I got my boarding pass scanned, the agent told me I've got an upgrade. Now, I don't want to complain about the upgrade, but why didn't they tell us at costumer service? They scanned our boarding passes there, and all in all three of us five go an upgrade, one of which had a gluten free meal. So they have planned the upgrade in advance. If they would have told us, we wouldn't have spent two hours on the floor.  Onboard, the Business Class was in a 2-3-2 configuration with angled flat beds. If I had paid money for this Business Class, I would have been mad at myself to not have flown any other airline. The FAs were polite, but not going out of there way to be polite. The meal was good.  No FA passed through to take care of passengers except for the meal times. This is below standard as well as the seat. In the IFE, there is the same ad as in Eco.

"Not Verified |  Writing review while in the aircraft to Dubai - EK 762 at 2158 Dubai time (24th September 2018) seat number 9D. Emirates business is deteriorating. 1) Check in: I had to wait at JNB because they were calling economy passengers to Business check in. 2) Lounge: Lounge at JNB quite good. The gentleman at d reception is rude and never smiled. In my over 100 lounge visits this year, never saw someone like him. He was busy on internet checking share prices. 3) Boarding: boarding was ok because boarding started before I came and mine was quick. 4) Flight: This particular business class experience is my worst to date. When I ordered a drink it took 20 mins. When I go to fetch it, the very rustic stewardess tells me she has to follow a certain order. And actually makes me wait another 10 mins before I get my drink. Food was shoddy from the first dish other than the apple tart. When I was sleeping they were celebrating with serving wine and other sweets to different couples, make them wear the funny Emirates hat and six of them including passengers were laughing away to glory while clicking pics. All this as promotion for Emirates when lights are out and people like me are trying to catch some sleep. Economy class, for third the price, offers much better experience. There is a reason why a Singapore or Qatar or Etihad get five star rating while Emirates can only make four.

I was irritated as I noticed other passengers boarding without being stopped to and they had more luggage. I assume this must be a routine check. My boarding luggage was 4KG excess. This was understandable considering the duty free items bought. I requested the lady to consider as I had only checked in one luggage and if need be, they check in my luggage. The lady suggested I speak to the gentleman. The gentleman would not hear of it! He was rude and started telling me if I want to complain, I can do that but I have to pay the excess! My luggage cannot be checked in! Since time was running out, I proceeded to pay for the excess luggage of 4KG. Upon waiting to issue my boarding pass, two gentlemen in front of me who were boarding had more luggage and the ladies (Different completely from the one who requested to check) told the gentlemen that they would check in their luggage without even checking how many luggage they originally had checked in! How unfair! When I started to complain, I was told time is running out and should proceed for the aircraft. The whole flight was a mess and I did not enjoy due to me being stressed out and worried about the funds I had paid whilst people in the aircraft had more luggage than me.Is this really fair?  I do not mind paying for excess but a fair check has to be done across everyone boarding.",9,2018-09-18,Kenya,True,dubai nairobi emirate preferred flying choice work personal even including family well treated like way came complete shocker since never ever treated like prior unworthy experience arrived flight taipei flight ek connecting nairobi via flight hour proceeded shop duty free mentioned trend checked one luggage kg taipei shopped chocolate upon heading boarding gate stopped emirate staff demanded weigh luggage boarding irritated noticed passenger boarding without stopped luggage assume must routine check boarding luggage kg excess understandable considering duty free item bought requested lady consider checked one luggage need check luggage lady suggested speak gentleman gentleman would hear rude started telling want complain pay excess luggage cannot checked since time running proceeded pay excess luggage kg upon waiting issue boarding pas two gentleman front boarding luggage lady different completely one requested check told gentleman would check luggage without even checking many luggage originally checked unfair started complain told time running proceed aircraft whole flight mess enjoy due stressed worried fund paid whilst people aircraft luggage really fair mind paying excess fair check done across everyone boarding
✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Dubai. Emirates will make you pay for an exit row seat and refuse any sort of refund when they move you involuntarily at the last minute due to a broken seat. Unfortunately a very poor experience and I feel cheated out of the extra money i paid for exit row seats. I was told at the boarding gate as I was about to board that my 2 prepaid exit row seats ($360 paid extra on top of my normal ticket) has a broken entertainment unit. The boarding gate staff advised me that they can move me to a normal seat and refund me my $360. I was annoyed but confirmed with the staff member on the spot that he will ensure I get refunded. He assured me he will see to it and moved my allocated seats. 4 weeks has passed with no refund. I contacted Emirates via their website and explained my situation and they refuse to consider a refund - Basically I paid for a service that I did not receive on my booked flight. I will keep following up this matter with Emirates. They do not provide any contact details or means to contact them other than a very restrictive e-form on their website. Smart way to not have to deal with unhappy customers I would say.,10,2018-09-16,Australia,True,sydney dubai emirate make pay exit row seat refuse sort refund move involuntarily last minute due broken seat unfortunately poor experience feel cheated extra money paid exit row seat told boarding gate board prepaid exit row seat paid extra top normal ticket broken entertainment unit boarding gate staff advised move normal seat refund annoyed confirmed staff member spot ensure get refunded assured see moved allocated seat week passed refund contacted emirate via website explained situation refuse consider refund basically paid service receive booked flight keep following matter emirate provide contact detail mean contact restrictive e form website smart way deal unhappy customer would say

Then when we got to the airport the lady who checked us in stated to go to the lounge for us to receive the Wheelchair - when we got there I was disgusted by the service where the lady stated we cannot help you with this and said she didn’t have a clue on this service, so My Partner was in even more pain and agony as he had to have this lengthy walk.

"✅ Trip Verified |  During my flight back home to Singapore from Dubai, I was given 41 A seat, so happy that it's located in exit area seat which means a nice leg room. After almost an hour of flying, I decided to watch using the IFE, known as ICE. I was shocked that my IFE monitor is not working plus my remote control. I even borrowed the control of my seat mate to call the attention of the flight stewardess. After few minutes of ""checking"", they finally give up. After almost an hour again, they offered me to transfer seat. Initially, I'm hesitant because I love my seat and its pretty quiet, but I realized that without entertainment for more than 7 hours of flight will kill me. Now, I find myself at 67G, which is also an ""exit"" seat. When I turned on the IFE, it's working, only to realized that I'm in the middle of the plane which means near the 4 engines which makes my flight uncomfortable.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Muscat to Guangzhou via Dubai. Everything was good in the inbound flight and there was no issue. On the other hand, my outbound flight had many issues. First of all, the agents who handled the check in were not polite and knowledgeable of English so that they can understand passengers and passengers can understand them. I had an agent who told me that I have 19kg excess baggage while I was sure that I have checked the baggage three times in my hotel and they were with in the limit. I asked the agent to double check and put them on the scale again individually since he was putting them all together and hand calculating the total weight. The agent refused to do so and refused to ask for his supervisor to come and kept saying ""It is Dubai, Check with Dubai"" He was about to return all the bags to me until I make the payment, I told him Ok check the bags and finish the check in so that my family and I will go and do the payment. He said ""first make payment and then will check the bags""! He kept my family standing there with my children and I went to do the payment. When I asked the other agent also to go and check or ask that guy in the counter to check she refused and said the same ""check with Dubai"". I paid the $570 for 19kg which I really think it is ridiculously insane charge for 19kg. In front of the gate, several agents were collecting the carry on bags to check them in for free and they did check all my carry on bags that weighs more than 20kg. Then they asked to take my cabin friendly baby stroller to check in because they where not aware of this type of strollers, although I informed them about it and showed them how it folds but they did not listen and they were unaware of this type of stroller. I purchased this type so that baggage handling dont break my stroller. They lost one of my baggage and I could not get it before the Eid.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Beirut to Manila via Dubai. I booked my exit seat ahead of time and paid an additional charge of $150USD per way for the seat only to find out that the seat closest to the exit door not only had no window and felt very claustrophobic, but the seat itself was smaller and tighter then all the other seats. On top of all this the seat itself was defective as it would not recline and stay reclined.

First, as a first class passenger I was unable to change my flights online (I had to go through the inconvenience of visiting the nearest Emirates office to do that.) Is this for real? And you expect me to return as a first class passenger Emirates? Second, the service was horrible! Can you believe it took them over 20 minutes to prepare breakfast for me? When I asked for the cause of the delay they claimed that it took time to heat the meal. However, when I ran back to the galley to take sugar for my hot chocolate I found 5 or 6 cabin crew having a meal and chatting together rather than looking after their first class passengers.

Check in at Heathrow Terminal 3 was quick and efficient and the lounge was marvellous especially for a plane spotter like myself. Boarding was smooth and a glass of nice Champagne offered before take-off. Staff were efficient and friendly and the food and wine offered were superb. Landed in Dubai and headed to lounge as the next flight to Melbourne departed at 2.20 am. Again a smooth boarding and even at that hour of the day a glass of bubbly was on offer and also the staff handed out hot towels and the mattress for the bed. Breakfast was promptly served and after a movie I slept for about 7 hours and then enjoyed a delicious lunch even though it was closer to dinner time at our destination. The multi national crew were fantastic. I usually ask where they come from and its almost like a mobile United Nations conference.

I was terribly unsatisfied with Emirates product on these flights. First, the 2-3-2 configuration on their B777-300 is outdated and lacks comfort and privacy. The seats are old and screens often don't work properly. On my flight from Dubai to Kuwait, on the A380, my seat was not even clean and i found toothbrush protection on the cocktail table. Second, on my 4 flights during my trip, only 1 crew was attentive and nice to me. The others were not caring about passengers and were snobby and arrogant. Dinner is served on a tray and food not nicely presented (i'd call it economy in business). As for beverages (I usually drink wine during dinner), you can't expect it to be served after you finished your dinner. The crew were disorganized. Last, the internet on board was not working on any of the segments. I am totally disappointed in this airline which markets itself as one of the best.

✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to London via Dubai. Early start with EK 409 departing Melbourne at 5.00 am so arrived at airport at 2.30 am to check in. Ground staff were great but warned me that immigration and security would not open until 3.00 am! As you can imagine with a full flight there were hundreds of passengers lined up to go through this process. Was given a priority lane pass which made the progress much easier. Boarding was prompt but could have stayed in the lounge as it had an excellent breakfast menu and great seating. On board was offered a glass of French which at 4.30 am is the only way to start the day. Seat was more than comfortable and the staff were first rate. Breakfast offering after take-off included a healthy option or the more traditional fare of bacon and eggs etc. The crew now use an electronic form on smart devices to take your order. Lunch was served 2 hours from landing and again an excellent choice. Landed on time and after 90 minutes it was off to London on EK 003. Again the crew were welcoming and drinks offered before take off and orders promptly taken when airborne. More food served before landing at London Heathrow and landing was right on time. On each flight passengers are offered a mattress to put on the seat and in some cases an extra pillow. ICE system is brilliant and a great selection to choose from and the cameras on the aircraft are a must watch for landing and take-off.

He was tasked with photographing all the researchers operating in that area and therefore had to take expensive photographic gear. We showed that gear to the Emirates check-in manager in New York, who gave us no trouble at all for carrying it on as hand luggage. Leaving Johannesburg, Emirates agents stopped us and the manager treated us terribly, telling us that we couldn't take the gear on the plane, that it was a safety hazard, blah blah. Our checked luggage was very light so we were not over in terms of the weight we were bringing on the flight. He told us that our only option was to sign a liability form and put the lenses in the hold. We might as well have thrown the gear into the street and watched the trucks run over it. This was the day before Christmas, and the airline basically threw us out to find our own way home at holiday time -- even though they had allowed us to fly in. We got no refund. We had to buy same-day tickets home on Delta -- and by the way, our hand luggage did not come even close to falling out of the overhead storage on that airline.

"Not Verified |  Totally disappointed with Emirates on the flights from Manchester to Dubai, and from Dubai to Manchester on the way back. Flights to and from Singapore the cabin crew were very good but airplane was old and some of the touch screens were not working and also the seats were not very good. The experience at Manchester airport was horrendous- that wasn’t the airlines fault. Once we got onto plane the plane though the experience didn’t improve the stewards and stewardesses looked bored and could not be bothered with passengers. When they did come round it felt as though they were just completing jobs without a care as to how they do it! Also noticed that the kids meals were not presented as they used to be 2 years ago when I last traveled with them. Dubai to Manchester on the 31st of July- firstly flight we had booked was supposed to be from Singapore to Colombo and then to Dubai, they had overbooked and as a result offered us a direct flight from Singapore to Dubai which we didn’t have an issue with. Flight from Dubai was a different story the cabin staff looked depressed and really difficult to deal with. You would ask nicely but their responses were really short and every time it was a no! Having had 3 children with us they were given breakfast part of which was cereal, all 3 were given different cereals which caused problems as they all wanted the same one, when the air stewardess was asked if she could check if there was this particular cereal available her answer was no straight away without even checking. Overall we just feel as a family in future we would rather travel long haul with other airlines as Emirates service was terrible and reading reviews we don’t appear to be the only ones. Emirates have started offering a saver fare which if you book be aware you will not be able to pre select your seats. Inflight entertainment was some of the worst I had seen - some of the movies were really old!

"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Manila via Dubai. Here is an airline that has deteriorated in a spectacular fashion. I have flown with Emirates since the late 90's and had not used them recently. I decided to use them this year. What a shock! This was not the Emirates that I used to know and liked immensely. Their aircraft are dirty and their staff, both on the ground and in the air, are inept and downright rude. In my particular case, i originally booked flights from Gatwick to Manila, via a two hour stopover in Dubai. After paying for the flights, Emirates emailed me to say that the schedules had changed and I was now on a flight from Heathrow with a one hour stopover in Dubai. To be honest, i was somewhat wary of such a tight connection time but I (in hindsight) stupidly trusted Emirates to get me to my destination on time. Well, the inevitable happened. The flight from Heathrow was delayed, thus causing me to miss my connecting flight to Manila. Incidentally, having checked this particular flight (EK004), it appears that it has been late departing from Heathrow virtually every evening. I would love to know how many other Manila bound passengers have missed their connection in this way over the last three months. The Emirates ground crew at Dubai were next to useless, accommodating us in a shabby hotel in Dubai for a few hours and then sticking us on a Hong Kong bound flight that evening, to connect with a Philippine Airlines flight the following morning. In short, a planned 17 hour, 1 stop journey became a 30 hour, 2 stop journey. I contacted Emirates and asked why we had not been placed on the direct flight from Dubai to Manila that evening. We would have still been late, but at least we would not have had to connect in Hong Kong. As yet, no answer. In fact, the response from Emirates has been condescending and wholly unsatisfactory. The Dubai ground crew and the Emirates customer service office give the impression that they are doing the delayed passengers a huge favour by shipping them out on a little bus to a Dubai hotel for a few hours and then placing them on later, non-direct flights. The customer services rep in his email to me even had the brass neck to point out how expensive it is for Emirates to re-book us on to another airline at Hong Kong.  Here's an idea Emirates, stop re-scheduling passengers on to flights with almost impossible connection times and get your passengers to their destinations as advertised. In conclusion, we missed a late evening meet up with friends in Manila and I had to fork out £160 for new internal flights to our final destination, as we had missed our original flights in Manila. Any potential Emirates passengers out there, read these reviews and take heed. Avoid the headaches and book with an airline who actually know what they are doing.

"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a connecting flight from London to Dar es Salaam via Dubai. Due to bad weather in Europe our plane was late departing and we spent over two hours on the runway. Consequently we missed our connecting flight in Dubai. When we finally reached Dubai there was complete chaos. There were 200+ other people who also missed connections and it was not clear where to go. We followed the crowd to the desk area for help there were only 4 Emirates staff helping over 200 people get to their final destinations. We were trying to get to Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania to meet a further connecting flight to start a 5 night safari. After after about a 45 minute wait we eventually got to speak to someone who said we could get an 8 hour flight to Johannesburg then a further flight to back to Dar Es Salaam. This would mean we would have got to Dar Es Salaam too late to catch our final connection and would have missed two days of our safari. Out of a 5 night safari this is a significant portion. When I complained I was told to stop wasting his time. Other people were also being badly treated. One other passenger found a replacement flight online and asked to be transferred but was told you've got your ticket don't speak to me anymore. Bearing in mind Emirates knew early on that the plane would be delayed they had over 8 hours to sort this out what they came up with was completely inadequate. It seemed everyone was being sent to Johannesburg. As the flight to Johannesburg was 4am the next morning we were sent to a hotel to wait. When we got to the hotel there were hundreds of other people waiting to check in as well. We queued in reception for over 3 hours to get our room but I'm not sure why we bothered as we had no luggage as this was still at the airport. Thankfully our tour operator Audley Travel managed to book us onto a flight to Zanzibar and then onto Dar Es Salaam in time to meet our final connection and only miss 1 day of our holiday and not 2. The flight to Zanzibar was with FlyDubai which is owned by the same people as Emirates. Why couldn't we have been offered this option by Emirates? You would hope this was the end of our bad experience with Emirates but no. When we went to come home we turned up at the airport in Dar Es Salaam over 3 hours before our flight was due to leave but were told by the check in staff that they could not print our boarding passes. The reason for this is because our tickets were out of sequence. It seems you have have to go wherever Emirates wish to send you in this case Johannesburg regardless of wether you wish to go there or not. We spent a further three hours at the airport in Dar Es Salaam not knowing if we would be able to go home. They said it was a security issue but they could clearly see our passports, they could see when we arrived in Tanzania as our visa was stamped with the date of arrival and they would have known our luggage had been transferred to a different flight. Only thanks to the persistence of the check in manager at Dar Es Salaam who spent over 2 hours on the phone and the immigration officials who sped us through security did we make the flight back home with only 2 minutes to spare. All in all I would definitely not recommend Emirates as an airline. It seems they can only run an airline if things run smoothly but are completely out of there depth if they hit a problem. The mark if a good company is how they deal with things when problems arise and in my view they completely failed",2,2018-08-08,United Kingdom,True,booked connecting flight london dar e salaam via dubai due bad weather europe plane late departing spent two hour runway consequently missed connecting flight dubai finally reached dubai complete chaos people also missed connection clear go followed crowd desk area help emirate staff helping people get final destination trying get dar e salaam tanzania meet connecting flight start night safari minute wait eventually got speak someone said could get hour flight johannesburg flight back dar e salaam would mean would got dar e salaam late catch final connection would missed two day safari night safari significant portion complained told stop wasting time people also badly treated one passenger found replacement flight online asked transferred told got ticket speak anymore bearing mind emirate knew early plane would delayed hour sort came completely inadequate seemed everyone sent johannesburg flight johannesburg next morning sent hotel wait got hotel hundred people waiting check well queued reception hour get room sure bothered luggage still airport thankfully tour operator audley travel managed book u onto flight zanzibar onto dar e salaam time meet final connection miss day holiday flight zanzibar flydubai owned people emirate offered option emirate would hope end bad experience emirate went come home turned airport dar e salaam hour flight due leave told check staff could print boarding pass reason ticket sequence seems go wherever emirate wish send case johannesburg regardless wether wish go spent three hour airport dar e salaam knowing would able go home said security issue could clearly see passport could see arrived tanzania visa stamped date arrival would known luggage transferred different flight thanks persistence check manager dar e salaam spent hour phone immigration official sped u security make flight back home minute spare would definitely recommend emirate airline seems run airline thing run smoothly completely depth hit problem mark good company deal thing problem arise view completely fail
"✅ Trip Verified |  Durban to Athens via Dubai. Emirates standards have dropped considerably. They don’t even have the food which they are offering on the menu, the menu offers a choice but when you choose the fish they say they don’t have. On this particular flight they even admitted they had hardly any of the fish option. On the next flight my wife was lucky enough to score the last chicken meal and I was forced to accept the beef. Also, the food was generally bland and I would hazard a guess they have changed caterers. They have also cut a few corners in the meal, for example the little chocolate has disappeared. They also didn’t offer the usual overnight packs (tooth brush, eye thingy etc)...when I enquired about this I was told they only offer these on flights exceeding 9 hours and the first leg of our flight was about 8 hours. This must be a new policy, as we have always received these packs.

✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Mumbai via Dubai. Food service on flight from Los Angeles to Dubai and return was one meal in second hour of flight and one pizza slice 2 hours before landing. This is what we were served on a 16 hour flight - they served soft drinks/juice and wine and alcohol 45 minutes after the first meal was served. Alcohol/wine is generally served 30 minutes prior to food service. The Dubai terminal was resembling a fish market. There were approx 120 seats near the gate. They are using A380-800 which is 475 to 500 passengers on a flight. The number of seats were totally inadequate. The staff serves food and drinks - but when you ask for something they dont have like Diet Coke/Diet Pepsi they say 'sir I have apple juice/orange juice' - They want passenger to believe they do not have Diet coke/diet pepsi. They are not willing to walk a bit and get the diet coke from the pantry for the passenger. Movies/TV shows were in large quantity but lacked quality.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Barcelona to Melbourne via Dubai. At the recommendation of the cruise company we booked with, who said they receive a very good deal with Emirates we had them book our flights. Prior to leaving we phoned Emirates to arrange seat allocations, after this was done we were informed that we were to be charged an extra $200AUD for this booking. After complaining to the cruise company they did pay this cost. This is the first time we have ever had to pay for booking seat allocations on any airline we have travelled on overseas. As my wife has a medical condition that prevents her from eating anything spicy we checked out the food options with Emirates and their representative was very understanding and recommended that the best option was a Western Vegan Meal, this was confirmed in a email from them. On the flight to Dubai/ Rome WHAT happens, my wife's meal arrives and if not the sauces then whether the fish,chicken,beef or pork all come out with curry in it. Regardless of complaints no other option available, no spare standard meal either. However, on the Dubai to Rome section when the same meal problem arose the cabin crew supervisor asked us for our flight details and said she would arrange to cancel this ""vegan"" meal option and it would mean my wife would have the choice of the regular meals on our return flights home from Barcelona. Somewhere in cyberspace this arrangement still lingers, for on our flight from Barcelona history repeated itself. Once again, No spare meals available so as before my wife had a whatever I could give her off mine, likewise the same issue came up on the flight from Dubai to Melbourne. Just to add insult to injury, as we were seated near the galley we saw meal trays dropped on the floor and the noise coming from there was loud to say the least, also we feel the toilets could have been more regularly checked as the basins needed cleaning and toilet rolls replaced as well as refuse bins emptied. Seated next to me was a young man with a liking for gin and tonics, He was seen ordering ""doubles "" e.g. two bottles at a time and also helping himself to the bar which was parked behind our seats. Added to this he decided it was more comfortable to squat on the seat with his posterior almost on the headrest of the seat. Of course what happened next was predictable, a full drink spilled all over me, so with using our blankets to clean up this mess and dry me off we needed two clean blankets. Request for same met with the reply that no spare blankets available, which meant we spent the rest of the flight cold no thanks to the air-con. However, just before arrival a flight attendant was seen collecting unused blankets and passed us with a large bag three quarters full of unused blankets, two of which I am sure could have been found with a little effort so we didn't go cold.

"✅ Trip Verified |  I can’t describe how upset I am by being stuck on Fl Dubai plane for 5 hours with no food, drink, in-flight entertainment or internet. I did book Moscow to Hanoi via Dubai  specifically to fly with Emirates, that cost me 650USD one way, compared to Aeroflot 650USD/round trip which is direct, modern and safe anyway. I paid twice as much just to have an experience with Emirates. Instead of Emirates plane I found myself in an outdated shabby unsafe little aircraft. I never been send to a low-cost instead of a full service. How is that even possible a company like Emirates co-shares with a lower cost. By co-sharing I mean they stuck me on a lower cost, send one meal, 1 cup of free water and let me carry 30kg of luggage. There was no choice of food and the suggested free dinner, only one option, was not suitable for me, no free snacks available no nothing. I had to buy water and peanuts. I booked a ticket with Emirates for my husband London-Dubai-Hanoi round trip and he had an amazing flight despite his flight was longer and the price was cheaper. I don’t book planes which sell water and sandwiches and I would never in a conscious mind choose Fly Dubai for a 5 hours flight, seats were uncomfortable even for my 5 feet. It was freezing cold the entire time and no blankets available, I couldn’t even hear the announcement it was just cracking noise. The whole experience felt like a charter flight in 90s, I never saw flight attendants just sleeping on the back row on a 5 hours flight before, our departure was also delayed because of late arrival. I couldn’t even charge my phone up to 60% in 5 hours, the equipment was that old! I have noticed that my flight is operated by FlyDubai on behalf of Emirates on my ticket but I have no idea what FlyDubai is and didn’t expect such a con being pulled off by Emirates. FlyDubai is not the same level as Emirates, if I wanted to fly with FlyDubai, in my case Emirates is a middle-man profiting by using the brand to sell cheap flights at high price.  I complained to the customer service afterwards but they just blamed me on not researching what FlyDubai is. So I guess they are aware of what they are doing but hope that people will be just tricked and book a ticket because of Emirates brand on it. Second flight Dubai-Hanoi was also pretty awful, just got a sandwich, croissant and an omelette in 7 hours flight, was pretty uneatable, the plane was very shabby as well. And at the check-in Emirates even tried to put me on standby because the plane was overbooked, even though I paid for my tickets 2 months in advance. guess Emirates don’t care about their customers as much as they did.",5,2018-07-12,Vietnam,True,describe upset stuck fl dubai plane hour food drink flight entertainment internet book moscow hanoi via dubai specifically fly emirate cost usd one way compared aeroflot usd round trip direct modern safe anyway paid twice much experience emirate instead emirate plane found outdated shabby unsafe little aircraft never send low cost instead full service even possible company like emirate co share lower cost co sharing mean stuck lower cost send one meal cup free water let carry kg luggage choice food suggested free dinner one option suitable free snack available nothing buy water peanut booked ticket emirate husband london dubai hanoi round trip amazing flight despite flight longer price cheaper book plane sell water sandwich would never conscious mind choose fly dubai hour flight seat uncomfortable even foot freezing cold entire time blanket available even hear announcement cracking noise whole experience felt like charter flight never saw flight attendant sleeping back row hour flight departure also delayed late arrival even charge phone hour equipment old noticed flight operated flydubai behalf emirate ticket idea flydubai expect con pulled emirate flydubai level emirate wanted fly flydubai case emirate middle man profiting using brand sell cheap flight high price complained customer service afterwards blamed researching flydubai guess aware hope people tricked book ticket emirate brand second flight dubai hanoi also pretty awful got sandwich croissant omelette hour flight pretty uneatable plane shabby well check emirate even tried put standby plane overbooked even though paid ticket month advance guess emirate care customer much
✅ Trip Verified |  Auckland to Birmingham via Brisbane / Dubai. The B777 on the Brisbane to Dubai leg was cramped and dirty. The A380 on the Dubai-Birmingham leg had more leg room. It was A380s on the return journey to Melbourne. Having heard people rate Emirates I was so disappointed. Each flight was late (by about an hour each time) departing. The cabin service was poor. We were offered one alcoholic drink for the whole of a 14 hour flight. The food was so salty as to be inedible and being on a special diet for medical reasons I couldn't eat anything that the airports offered. If the baggage locker over your seat row was full you had to find space somewhere else which could be several rows back. The cabin crew refused to help. So no I never want to use this airline again.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Santiago to Sao Paulo. After my original flight from Latam being cancelled last minute (without an explanation from either branch in both countries until the next day after the flight would have left, I was forced to book a last minute (6 days in advance) cheapest flight I could find out of the country. I came across Emirates and booked a direct, roundtrip flight from Santiago to Sao Paulo for over $800. When arriving at my gate and waiting for my flight, my flight information was not up on the screen when it was supposed to be boarding. It said the UAE flight with whatever number (which, i guess in their defense was the same number as my EK flight) heading to Dubai was posted. confused, I looked at the screen of all the departing flights and mine was not mentioned. Remember, I was going to Sao Paulo, Brazil, not Dubai, UAE. I went up the workers at the Dubai counter asking them if they knew where my flight got cancelled since it would have been the same company. They said that was the same flight. The screen only said Dubai and had a different flight code. I never would have known that was my flight. We asked the workers several times to clarify that we were going to be getting off in Brazil since if they were wrong we would end up on the other side of the world. They confirmed again. I will compliment them on their politeness and calmness as I was definitely not very calm with them. Nowhere on the website, the check in online, my ticket, with the bag drop employee, or anywhere /one was it mentioned that the final destination was Dubai and Sao Paulo was just a stop over. Of course, when we were about the depart they were having brake issues for an hour, as well. Everything worked out in the end thankfully and they did serve a generous amount of food. But I would suggest posting (or at least notifying) passengers at least once of both / all destinations.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Rome to Dubai. An excellent flight on Emirates. Boarding at FCO on the A380 now faster, smoother thanks to the new departure gate at FCO with dual level air stairs. Nice welcome on board by smiling, professional crew. Took off 30 mins late due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft (due, no doubt, to delays at DXB during the morning departure rush between 07.30 - 10.00) but time was made up and we later landed on schedule. Someone says on earlier report that EK doesn't ask for feedback? There's a digital survey card contained within ICE or you can report your comments to one of the cabin supervisors. I did this as I wanted to comment on the fact that EK no longer offers a pre-lunch drinks service on this route instead combining the meal and cocktail service together. I understand why this is - some people want to eat as soon as they sit down - but it does make the initial part of the cabin service rather rushed, which is unnecessary on a 5.5 hour flight. In the past on this route ice cream was served about 4 hours into the flight but this has now been replaced with a sandwich and tea / coffee. Lunch, incidentally, was excellent (braised beef, gratin potatoes and the most delicious crumble for dessert), and I write that as someone who doesn't usually take the meal on this sector. Being extra picky here but it's a shame Campari is no longer offered as a cocktail in economy but good to note there was a selection of three different types of red wine. Everyone knows the ICE entertainment system is absolutely superb and caters for all nationalities / languages, I often watch Italian or French movies. This time, it even included live World Cup football. And the economy seats on EK's A380s are so comfortable and spacious.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Zagreb via Dubai. I am quite disappointed with the general experience with Emirates. The taste catering is bad and the sandwiches are too dry to eat. The seat is of average space, but your space will be highly deprived when the front seat reclined. The TV appears to be too bright and it hurts the eyes. I could not watch the flight information on some of the flights. The thing that I am most furious is about the online system of Emirates. The website lags and you have very few choice in online check in as all passengers are pre-allocated a seat before check in.

"Not Verified |  London to Adelaide via Dubai / Brisbane. I am very surprised that huge airlines like Emirates do not ask you to review them after your flight. Do they not want to know about problems or have feedback? Obviously not. I heard it was rated best airline but by whom? I have travelled with them and other large airlines but not been asked to vote for them good or bad. Well I review them as bad. It is not made clear during booking how much seat allocation is going to cost you until after you have paid for your flight (apparently hidden somewhere in the smallprint) You should have the opportunity DURING the booking process to add your chosen seats then you would not have to add them on extra later. I paid £180 for return flight for me and my child to sit together. That was just allocating the two cheapest seats together. The flights were £1500+. They told me I could book 2 seats together within 48 hours of flying for free if there were any left - thats if. The airport terminal in Dubai is enormous and we only just made it to the gate for the next leg on time. They need longer on the ground before next flight. Myself and my son, the people to my side that I could see clearly did not eat the food apart from scones. The green sausages looked like plasticine. The white sausages again looked and tasted of plasticine. It states clearly on the website all children travelling will be allocated child meals automatically 24 hours before travel. They do not. If I wanted my child to have child meals I had to personally phone on all 4 legs of the journey to book each one. It is not available to do this online, but meals like kosher and vegetarian are! Ridiculous. And when we boarded, after an hour of take off my son was really thirsty so pressed the bell for water - it took over 40 minutes for him to be attended and the people behind me kept pressing too but nobody came to them either.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Larnaca to Singapore via Dubai. Our flight from Cyprus got delayed more than an hour so we missed our connecting flight from Dubai to Singapore. As all other airlines do we thought that a group of flight attendants wold escort us to the new gate to catch the next flight, we also informed the flight attendants in our flight from Cyprus to Dubai to do so and they ensured us that this was going to be done and nothing to worry about. We needed to reach Singapore the following morning as we had a very important meeting arranged at the airport. However coming out the aisle none called our names and none would answer our questions on how to reach the next gate. They would only tell us that we missed the next flight as well and that there is no chance of us arriving on time to the gate to get the next one.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Venice via Dubai. I have been flying Emirates for many years and always praised and recommend it. Not this time. And I am very angry and disappointed. I was wheelchair bound and when I arrived at the check in at Melbourne all seemed fine... until I have been taken 3 hours before my flight to the gate, gate 11 empty, alone and abandoned there. No water no one to ask for help no chance to go to a toilet as I needed assistance. When finally an attendant arrived to open the gate, I asked her if I could have a glass of water and needed a toilet she said there was none around and I had to go to another area. I was boarded and kindly a flight attendant on the plane helped me to the toilet and gave me a glass of water. She felt terrible for what I experienced but could not do much about it. She tried to make a sort of a stool with a bag to make me stretch my leg. When arrived in Dubai they told me I had to go to the service desk and tell them what happened. The guy in Dubai who took me on my wheelchair, instead, left me for a while “parked” while he was happily chatting with other friends until I waved to get his attention and asked again to be taken to the service desk. Finally at service desk I explained the situation and what I had endured in Melbourne. They said they would take me to the lounge to wait. The guy brought me to another plane where I was left, and almost missed my flight to Venice! When I received an alert from Emirates to go straight to the gate I tried to get attention again!!)!  Arrived at the gate they changed  my seat. Previously I had a seat with empty ones right and left to allow me to raise my leg and stretch it on other and I thought the change was similar.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Venice to Melbourne via Dubai. I am now on my way back to Australia and yet again experiencing the worst customer service ever from Emirates. Just before my departure I had received an offer to upgrade from economy to business for part of my return trip from Dubai to Melbourne for AU$ 1157 . As my leg had not yet healed ( did my way into Europe on a wheelchair) and although feeling much better, I thought I could do this effort and upgrade so that I could be more comfortable. Before my departure I tried several times to do the online upgrade but unsuccessfully, as every time i filled everything and clicked “upgrade” a message came out that “the system was down”! (Note that my card was more than capable of covering the cost hence it was not a payment issue ) Tried again before I had to catch my first flight but then I had to board and had to let go. Arrived in Dubai I went to the service desk where there was only single person available to do the ticketing service and was stuck serving a person for over 20 minutes! I had another person before me and I knew I would never had time to wait so I went to another side of the service desk to ask for assistance. The lady said no one else could assist and also that she knew for sure I could not upgrade with that offer anymore as I had already started the first leg. When I explained that I did try many times to do the upgrade online before my flight but the Emirates website did not work and a message came out that the system was down (so it was not my fault) they just said they could not do anything and if I wanted to upgrade the price would not have been the same! On the plane I asked again. They had quite a few empty seats in business but they asked almost 4 times as much as the offer I had in my email (asked around 3.500 US dollars for one leg upgrade on the plane! While my offer was 1157 Australian dollars for the same which equals to us$ 864) I am so angry and disappointed but, if you want to see this from a marketing point of view Emirates has lost both in image and in money.

"✅ Trip Verified | Cape Town to Melbourne via Dubai. Check-in and boarding in Cape Town were smooth. The flight to Dubai on a B777 was pleasant, with a comfortable seat which had adequate storage, and excellent food. The service was efficient but rather formal. The IFE on this flight was quite clunky. At Dubai we were bussed to the terminal, but as there was a dedicated Business Class bus this process was quite painless. Both the terminal itself and the Emirates lounge were very busy just after midnight. The second flight on an A380 was a big step up in luxury, with a more spacious seat, much more storage, more friendly cabin crew and very smooth IFE. Something went wrong with my vegetarian meal order, but it was cheerfully fixed.

"Not Verified |  Brussels to Tokyo via Dubai. Plenty of flights with Emirates the last few weeks with several round trips to Sydney, Brisbane and Tokyo. Being a Platinum member, Emirates upgrade me from Business to First every 4-5 flights. I rate Business class on the A380 above Business on the 77W, but also better than First. The seat in First remains awkward. To me, Emirates are outstanding for route network, lounges services and catering, website booking/managing, chauffeur pickup, seat comfort, onboard wifi, crews, and of course their unique ICE inflight entertainment. Where Emirates do not get their act together however, is for inflight catering, which remains surprisingly awful also in First. I always eat at the airport before my flight.

My luggage was weighed by Emirates staff (One cabin bag and a laptop bag) and I was passed through. At next stage a female staff informed that I couldn't carry my cabin luggage as there is not much space inside the flight and I will need to Check-it in. I requested to carry it inside and explained it had original property documents which were very important and I couldn't check it in (I even opened my bag and showed her that there were only the documents). While I was talking to her the Supervisor came to me, grabbed my luggage in very rude manner and took luggage back to weighing place and told I am not allowed to take a laptop bag. I explained that it is mentioned on my tickets that one carry-on item such as laptop is allowed. He said your other bag is heavier than allowed limit and I will need to pay the money for that. I told it was already passed from Washington Airport as well as here (Dubai) also. It looked like that other staff there was also not comfortable with his behavior.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to Melbourne via Dubai with Emirates in May 2018. It was genuinely a disappointing trip and  confirmed just how overrated Emirates is. On the AMS-DXB sector, every Cabin Crew member genuinely looked like they did not want to be there. People would move out of their way in the aisle to make way for the crew and were never given a single smile or ""thank you"" of acknowledgement. They were far from friendly, could not crack a smile, and appeared like emotionless robots. The seats were so uncomfortable and you could feel the framework of them beneath your behind because the seats had been sat in so many thousands of times without re-upholstering. That's not very comfortable for a 14 hour flight. The entertainment system was a joke. Please don't get me started on it. On not one, but both sectors, there was no recognition in their system that I had requested a vegetarian meal, so I was lucky to be graced with ""untouched leftover"" vegetarian meals on both sectors, but only for one meal on each flight. The Cabin Crew on the first flight couldn't stop reminding me how lucky I was and that it was my fault and patronised me, repeatedly saying ""mmm yes, just next time you must request your meal beforehand."" They seemed to have not listened to a word I said. Regardless, there was not even a vegetarian option on the actual menu.",10,2018-05-26,Australia,True,amsterdam melbourne via dubai emirate may genuinely disappointing trip confirmed overrated emirate am dxb sector every cabin crew member genuinely looked like want people would move way aisle make way crew never given single smile thank acknowledgement far friendly could crack smile appeared like emotionless robot seat uncomfortable could feel framework beneath behind seat sat many thousand time without upholstering comfortable hour flight entertainment system joke please get started one sector recognition system requested vegetarian meal lucky graced untouched leftover vegetarian meal sector one meal flight cabin crew first flight stop reminding lucky fault patronised repeatedly saying mmm yes next time must request meal beforehand seemed listened word said regardless even vegetarian option actual menu
"✅ Trip Verified | This was my first experience with Emirates, and I was surprised how average it was. Maybe expectations were too high, but this experience was just not as good as Emirates promotes itself (best airline? Really?) The aircraft was not new and a few seats were damaged. The cabin was not clean. The staff were not friendly, and once they totally ignored my request for assistance. Entertainment system was not very handy: the touchscreen was not working properly on both flights, so I had to use an old and an uncomfortable joystick. I didn't like the selection of movies, either - there were many movies in the database (including Asian, Bollywood etc) but all of the Western movies were more or less of the same genre. Same with TV shows. The dinner was very good, however, only one real meal on a long haul flight was not sufficient (only an old sandwich was given before landing). There were no snacks or beverages in between. No amenity kits provided. There was wifi onboard; 2 hours free. On a positive note, you can check-in 2 bags, 32 kg each. Overall, it was all okay because Emirates flight was the cheapest one among all flights available for this route and date.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Hong Kong. This was truly a flight to remember. The seat went beyond comfortable; it was luxurious. This was a short flight, so my interest in the IFE was limited to the flight map and the external cameras - what a treat! There were so many flight attendants assigned to the business cabin that the service was personalized and super attentive. Once again, I enjoyed the lounge food so much that I had little appetite left for the elaborate onboard meal. I ordered the ""mild"" chicken curry. I should known that my interpretation of mild and that of the Thai catering service might vary considerably. I had contacted Emirates customer service ahead of the flight with a special request. Their communication was exemplary, and they accommodated me beyond what I Had hoped for.

✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas to Dhaka via Dubai. Nightmare in the Sky! Horrible Experience! The flight from USA to Dubai was a chaos! They have messed up the seating arrangement for most of the passengers. They changed my assigned seat. It was an aisle seat but they changed it to a middle seat. And again changed it back as I complained after boarding the aircraft. The interior of the aircraft looked old and not clean. The worst part was food. Chicken/prawn curry with rice. These were my options and I choose chicken curry.  Snack was a small pizza which was a joke. I was hungry for the whole duration of the flight. The ticket was expensive so it was surely not a value for money.  It used to be good but now it is a hell in the sky if you have a long flight.

"✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong to Bangkok. Departure delayed by an hour due to a technical fault which could not be fixed with another Emirates A380 due to fly HKG non-stop to DXB three hours 25 minutes earlier. Some passengers from that flight were transferred to ours. But why that should have resulted in a lengthy delay to our flight beats me and was never explained. As a result we had to sit on board for over an hour before push-back. Once again I found the revised upper deck layout with 100 or so Y passengers in front of business class especially annoying, this time with what seemed like a major raucous party taking place just a few rows in front of my seat. Having travelled for much of the day and connected in HKG, I found it impossible to relax, the more so as the plane was being refuelled and the lighting full on. How come refuelling took place after the scheduled departure time given that our aircraft had arrived in HKG several hours earlier? Although hungry, I skipped dinner as midnight was just too late for me. All I wanted was try and sleep but even that was difficult with the short flight time. I appreciate that technical issues do occur and I felt sorry for those who had to be involuntarily rerouted via BKK and would as a result arrive late in DXB by six hours or more. For those of us who had elected to take the Bangkok flight, though, this was maddening!

"✅ Trip Verified |  I had prepurchased a seat for extra legroom, but the layout didnt state that the seat is next to the staff kitchen/pantry. And because of this, I receive constant noises and laughter from the staff, even when the public lights are off, waking me up at several times. That's not all, I had paid for extra legroom, but people are constantly knocking my long stretch legs over, causing me to retract my legs all the time. Hence, the irony of purchasing an extra legroom when in fact, I don't get any throughout the flight. To make things worst, there are 2 staff seats opposite our seats, so during landing and take off, 2 staff will be sitting there. And because they are sitting there, I have to retract my  legs again. I'd paid for extra legroom, but in the end, it was a terrible experience. Never again am I going to prepurchase a legroom at the sides of the plane, especially from Emirates. Terrible experience. As for the other experiences, most of the crew were ok, they will serve and do their job, but lack the smile on their face. Not that they look rude or unhappy, it's just not the expression you will receive in flights like Singapore Air. Inflight entertainment was good, great contents, but the touchscreen was terrible.

"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew from London to Manila via Dubai and back. Boarding wasn't stressful. Legroom was good and the seats had a good recline. It was enough for me to sleep when I needed to. However, I did get very numb towards the end of the flights. At 8-9 hours per leg, this wasn't unexpected. The quality of the food was good. I had the gluten free meal and my partner the normal. Both flavour, variety and good portion sizes. I didn't feel like the gluten free option meant I had substandard food, so I would take this into account if you have any intolerances. The entertainment was very good. We were spoilt for choice for films and TV shows, and the inflight status was a nice extra. The larger screens were on two of our flights, and were much more responsive than the smaller, older versions on our other two flights. For the smaller screens, we just used the physical controllers, but these were easy enough to use too. All of the staff were highly professional, prompt and courteous. We had a few smiles as well.  All in all I'm very happy with my experience from Emirates. The flight weren't cheap at £580 return, but there were many cheaper options available.

"✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Istanbul via Dubai. I’ve used Emirates for connecting flights several times and decided never to use it again. I recommend everyone to avoid a connecting flight in Dubai with Emirates. The airport is huge and making a transfer in the airport requires a lot of time and patience. It is always very crowded and even finding somewhere to sit except restaurants or cafes sometimes impossible. There are always long queues for security checks. The terrible flight experience in my recent flight proved it: Emirates recommends to spare at least 1 hour for making transfer in Dubai. In my latest flight from Bangkok to Istanbul, the connection time was 1hour 15 minutes. The flight from Bangkok to Dubai delayed 45 minutes, which means that I will definitely miss my flight in Dubai to Istanbul. Despite this fact, ground staff in Bangkok reassured me that I would make the connection and there would be a ground staff at Dubai airport waiting to assist for the connection flight to Istanbul. When I arrived at Dubai airport 45 minutes delayed, the ground personal informed me that my seat to Istanbul was cancelled and handed me the voucher for a hotel and food. She told me that my flight would be tomorrow at 2.30 pm UAE time. With no further assistance she left. I had many more troubles in the latter times of my journey. The response I received from the customer service regarding my complaints were not satisfactory and disrespectful. My latter complaints were totally ignored. Other issues with this airline: Their seat layout 3-4-3 seat, which means the corridors are thin and the cabin is filled more passengers. It makes you feel claustrophobic.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Birmingham to Cape Town via Dubai.

At no point during the flight booking did it flag up the fact these documents were required.

Surely the need for birth certificates etc should be flagged on entering each passengers DOB to prevent this happening. I contacted the South African immigration whilst the man continued to deny my daughter and told that they would have had no problem allowing my 16 year old daughter to enter. Still she was refused.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Bangkok. Emirates have an economy class seats on the upper deck of their A380. I got the chance to reserve the seat in advance. The upper cabin is spacious than the lower cabin with 2-4-2 layout. Add to that the side storage bins for those seating in the window seat. The flight was full because of the Songkran Festival in Thailand. Drinks and a small pack of biscuit was given right after take off. Lunch was serve almost two hours into the flight which i guess is a bit early for a 6 hour flight. Drinks and wet towel were provided before we land. The front lavatory on the upper deck are spacious. Unfortunately, those seating on the upper deck cannot go down the lower deck to roam and stretch their legs. Emirates' ICE is was superb.

✅ Trip Verified |  Hyderabad to New York via Dubai. Emirates standards have really dropped. Cons: Emirates b class lounge in terminal b in morning time is a joke. Food is consistently bad in these lounges and there is no a la carte. There is not a single chair to sit on. Horrible experience. Very noisy with spoons and plates clattering all the time. There are a ton of food options but all of them mass produced and on a hot dish. In flight experience also Emirates has no a la carte concept. Either you chose from that menu in those 3 hours or forget about it. No good soups or mild flavours they again gs for quantity over quality. During the entire time of 15 hours cabin crew is going by back and forth making sleep difficult. TheWorst part however is the fact that there is lounge in JFK. This is simple not acceptable. They give a 40 usd voucher which you can Use in any restaurant but almost all restaurants were closing. So I had a glass of wine and fries in McDonald’s. This is unacceptable. Pros: flight attendants on all sectors were very nice and tried to make up for an old and tired airline.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Christchurch. Incompetence of Emirates check-in personnel that may cost me over $400 On April 8, 2018, my wife and I were travelling on EK412 from Sydney to Christchurch. We were carrying an expensive PC as a gift to our daughter for her graduation from the university that we purchased in Australia and we planned to claim tax refund. It’s a common knowledge (and a common sense, too) that goods need to be produced to a tax refund officer to obtain tax refund. To our knowledge, at Sydney Airport tax refund office is located beyond check-in, immigration and security and I intended to bring the PC there. The box was pretty bulky, and I was told that I had to check it in. It was a natural question that I asked the check-in assistant – how was I supposed to produce it to a tax refund officer if I do that. The junior assistant who was checking us in didn’t know the answer and asked her supervisor by name David. David assured us that producing receipt to a tax refund officer was sufficient to claim tax and that goods don’t need to be necessarily produced if they’re checked in, so we checked the box in along with our luggage. At the tax refund office, the officer requested me to produce the goods besides the receipt, which I was unable to do. The officer then said that I had to produce it to a tax refund officer located before check-in point, of which the airline should have informed me. When I replied that the airline advised me that the good don’t need to be produced to a tax refund officer and producing receipt alone is sufficient to claim tax refund, the officer still accepted my claim but it’s now up to decision of the main office in Canberra, whether I will receive tax refund after not being able to produce the goods. Thus, the incompetence of Emirates check-in personnel in matters of tax refund may cost me over $400 if my claim is ultimately not entertained.

"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Hong Kong to Dubai. In general, the service of Emirates has been bad on my recent experience, that included check-in and in-flight.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Cape Town via Dubai. We chose to experience Emirates based on their reputation, despite taking a longer route via DBX. Apart from the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screen, the flight was fine. Cabin temperature could have been slightly warmer for comfort. The second leg from Dubai to Cape Town on an older 777 was much less than perfect. On one of our seats the overhead light was not working and given this was a night flight needed. Whilst on the stand I reported this to a member of staff who told me that they could not move us to another seat as we were a couple. We had the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screens with random actions and scrolling cursors. The area we were seated in was extremely cold and my wife ended up using four of the airline blankets to try and be warm enough to get some sleep. I went for a walk around the economy area and found in all other areas the temperature was adequate. We appeared to be sat below an air con portal blowing cold air. This affected say ourselves and another dozen or so passengers who could be spotted by their huddled looks with coats and blankets. When I asked about this I was told that “Computer says” it’s 25 degrees. In our zone it was probably about 12 degrees. The member of staff was dismissive. It would have been bad enough if they had agreed but apologised that nothing could be fixed in-flight. I decided to seek the supervisor. In regards to the heating they did accept there was a fault and that staff should have not tried to ignore the issue. On the matter of the overhead light they said that we could have been reseated in row 50 as there was space at take off. They agreed with comments about the issues and the poor customer service. They said they would take immediate verbal action with staff in flight and would file a report regarding my issues at base. They presented me with a business card without names on and an email address to write to. On arrival in Cape Town I sent a comprehensive report to the alleged customer service email on the business card. I received a curt rejection pointing me to the on-line complaints form. Emirates customer complaints response indicates that their target is to respond in 30 days. Having heard nothing before we were heard nothing before we were due to fly back home. On my return via Johannesburg, I asked to speak to the Emirates group side manager, to see if anything had been planned in response to our complaint. After a long period of time the manager informed me that it was with the UK Customer Relations unit and still under investigation. To date still no contact some 37 days later. On the return trip home my wife encountered a problem with a member of staff pointing her finger to get out of the way effectively, without saying a word. Another poor PR exercise was a steward reading a tablet and in the hearing of others selecting a passenger individually and indicating they were a frequent customer and if there is anything I can do for you my name is...  My general feeling is that Emirates is resting on its historic reputation. Having flown Qatar Airways they are still maintaining customer services a better standard.

Breakfast was very unsatisfactory, basically fruit and bread which is nothing exciting for me to talk about. The IFE was amazing, with its many options I was entertained the whole flight.

"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Amsterdam to Dubai. Emirates has some of the laziest cabin crew in the industry. The quality of their service has been tanking for years now and whereas small details used to set a new standard, most of these details are no longer offered. I have flown Emirates many times and somehow they never manage to leave on time - and rarely do they make up for lost time. This flight for example landed 40 minutes past schedule. When you leave later and spend more time on board, details start to matter. Like for example how long it takes before meals are served. But even as important as when the meal trays are collected. The first they try to stall for obvious reasons, they used to serve 2 meals on these flights and now 1 and some crackers. The later they serve it, the less obvious the difference. The second causes unnecessary annoyance. When you’re in a window seat and have to wait for 1 hour and 40 minutes for them to clear the trays - and you have to use the toilet - you’re going to start having doubts about their service. Their crew are more occupied getting to know each other and sharing party stories than being involved in the service they should offer. In the absence of alternatives like Qatar Airways, you’re almost forced to fly Emirates to most of the Middle East, which is another annoyance. I am starting to give up hope the Emirates of the 2008-2013 era will ever return.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Rome. I'm so disappointed. I have been flying with EK since 2002 and in the last 3 years i have seen a constant decline. It has now hit the bottom. Travelling to Rome has been a disaster from the start. At online check in, i could not find seats next to my 9 year old son. I couldn't book his seat without paying extra 50$ (my seat was free because of skywards) on top of the 900$ premium cost of the ticket itself (seriously this is what you claim in your radio ads favouring families). Called the call center. First time i was told there are no seats available (yet the app shows seats on rows 22, 23, 36 and 50).

"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Chennai via Dubai. I really had a very bad experience with Emirates.  I didn't know that number of bags reduced from 4 to 3 and the front desk people asked me to arrange bags and charged me 10lb extra weight fee of $50 and verified my cabin bag weight(8kg). After cleared the security, I bought some duty free stuffs from Chicago ORD airport and there is no question in Chicago airport boarding.After I reached Dubai when I board Chennai Airport Emirates staff asked me to weight cabin bag and duty free stuff and they said everything has to be placed in the cabin bag. They kicked out me out of the queue and asked me to arrange my luggage. I spent 10-15 minutes to arrange everything. After arranging every stuffs they said my cabin is overweight (includes duty free stuff). They suggested to reduce weight by throwing some stuff in trash or return duty free stuffs. Since the duty free stuffs I bought from US I couldn't able to return and they said I need to pay fee then only they can let me in. Staff behavior is totally not unacceptable, Emirates staffs are trying to steal money from customers my saying you have addition weight on your luggage. Staffs didn't say anything about the price detail and they charged me USD120 which more than the dutyfree stuff/10lb extra weight. Finally I saw my card was Charged $120 for $80 dollar stuff. This is my worst travel experience ever. If you have a policy then why are you allowing the duty free in ORD airport and not Dubai. If the duty free stopped in ORD airport I would have returned in ORD airport. Since the duty free stuffs are allowed in ORD I couldn't able to return in Dubai and I am force to pay. I am returning back to US today and restricted my baggage today to avoid any confusion but there is no cabin baggage verification or weight check happened today. Few of the economy passengers have both Cabin luggage and back pack and some of them have cabin luggage, back pack and Duty free from Dubai but no one was checking.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Athens to Newark. On a scheduled 11 hour flight from Athens, not once except with meals were refreshments offered, including water, and beverages, etc. This was a flight during daylight hours so the cabin crew did not have a reason to not offer drinks. When a person requested a beverage it was obvious that the cabin crew was annoyed with the request, even though their ads on the inflight entertainment was stressing to stay hydrated during the flight. This was just the opposite of our experience on Singapore airline where the cabin crew came through about every 30 minutes offering drinks, sandwiches, fruit and candy bars including Toblerone candy bars. I was surprised n the difference in service between Emirates and Singapore Airlines.

But the service is appalling, really disappointed if this is the kind of service we get in Business Class - what about Economy?

She noted it down and breakfast time came and went and I kept waiting for mine - at about the end of the breakfast hostess explains that the breakfast what I ordered is not there and I have to pick something else. Couple of things here, they decide to come and tell me that they are out when the flight is about the descent to the destination, and hostess who knew that I skipped Dinner does not bother to come and explain the same earlier. Regardless, I had lost my appetite by then - asked them to not bother, but they insisted to get a hindu meal(as that was the only thing available), but that turned out to be stale.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Brussels to Chennai via Dubai. Major concerns regarding Emirates flight and ground staff support at Dubai. My mother was traveling Emirates from Brussels to Chennai with stopover in Dubai. Knowing her medical condition, I ensured she would have a wheelchair from departure to destination for each flight. Due to her medical condition, she’s unable to walk. This wheelchair was once again confirmed prior to her flight. And again after her flight experience. Each time an Emirates representative told me that her wheelchair is booked all along each stop. However on 23rd February 2018, upon arrival in Dubai, she wasn’t given a wheelchair, instead ground staff rudely told her she had to walk as they couldn’t accommodate her a wheelchair.  Did not expect this from Emirates. As a result my mother was helped by 3 other passengers who helped her reach her connecting flight.  At this point I’m besides myself and have no words to express my fury over Emirates and its customer service. On her return flight on March 6, we had made multiple calls and emails requesting the highest level of wheelchair (apparently Emirates has levels of wheelchairs). Yes once again, she was denied a wheelchair at Dubai airport. Instead, Ground staff made her walk.

In my backpack I carry my iPad, laptop, and occasionally a camera. I have travelled many airlines all business class with two carry-on pieces. For the first time, I was stopped at the Dubai Airport at the gate by Emirates gate agents and asked to pay an additional $80 dollars to get on Flight EK542 to Chennai on February 24 because my carry-on luggage was apparently over the weight limit. At the same time, there were a number of other business-class passengers who were allowed to board the aircraft with more than two carry-on pieces or carry-on pieces that were larger than what was allowed. I was not asked to pay extra on any of the other flights on this booking. Only on this flight going to Chennai. I pointed out that I was coming from Chicago, had no check-in luggage, and the check-in desk in Chicago had no problem with my luggage. I also pointed out that I travel business class all the time on many different airlines and this is the first time that I was being asked to pay extra at the gate.

While other airlines were distributing food coupons after the delayed flights Emirates said they'll transfer us to hotel in their coach. We stood at the conveyor belt and collected my luggage which were distributed between two belts. We came out to find out that there is no coach, no hotel. Emirates made the promise while they were trying to arrange for hotels, they either don't know their verbs or plain lied. Their latest version was 'we are suggesting you go home and we will contact you when you are rescheduled'.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Dubai. I was sitting in 42C (originally sitting on 42B but changed seats by someone else) on the aisle. The flight was really full that it was trying to get all travelers from Hong Kong and nearby cities to Dubai. The boarding gate was fair that I need to take the train to my boarding gate.  Cabin crew were nice and ready to help us. The meal selection included either Chicken or Beef, which I chose the Chicken with pasta which I think the taste is fair, not really good at all. I had ordered their cup noodles as well but it was neither taste well . The ICE flight entertainment is really good, however the hardware was not so adapted into it. The plane was quite old and they use the setup which years ago does. I could understand with that but I think it's time to get some renovation on that plane, which they could change to the setup on their Boeing 777-300ER. After some time of sleep, the snack came with Beef sandwich with drinks. Even though the sandwich was dry, it tastes better than the dinner. Before the flight landed, some travelers attempted to change seat even though the belt sign was on for a while, the cabin crew had to yell to stop them but those travelers changed anyway.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Travelled from Birmingham to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai, with a 24 hrs stop in Dubai on return. Chauffeur came on time as arranged. Lovely chap. Got to BHX. Dropped off directly outside check in. First time at this airport and not impressed. Lounge is small with a selection of warm food. Struggled to get reception to use mobile. Seat 20A although business class felt claustrophobic. Food was nicely presented. Wasn’t too keen on starter (the chicken mango confit) main Opted for duck which was lovely. No amenity bag given on day flight. Which is a shocker. Flight was full as such the bar area was packed. Arrived at DXB connecting flight in concourse B. Business lounge seem like a free for all where they allowed anyone in. Over crowded and not enough seating. Showers busy, dark and outdated. Flight to KL seats better. Night flight food was breakfast. Had the omelette which wasn’t overly nice. Arrived on time. Had to get train to the baggage hall. 1st one to arrive. My flight companion bag came off 1st. However due to error by BHX not labelling my bag correctly with business tag it came off around an hour later with the economy passengers. As such missed my connection. Anyway return journey in business lounge in KL very small. Showers were a bit worn out and not clean. Food was barely warm and limited. Night flight and managed to get a few hours sleep. Breakfast served was same as on way in therefore wasn’t too keen. Just had hot chocolate and cake. Arrived 4:30am. Had 24 hrs in Dubai. Freshened up in lounge then went into Dubai city.

There was a nice white area with a lounge chair where I managed to get a few hours sleep before the flight. Boarded return to Manchester. Again night flight. Breakfast options so slept all way.

Seats had a lot of leg room. I was sat next to the window and didn't feel claustrophobi, probably as the plane's walls don't curve in so much on the lower deck and the windows are so large. Main problems were the IFE wasn't working properly - plus  the system was trying to offer too much (i.e. loads of films) without much thought gone into the execution and ease of use of it.

"✅ Trip Verified | We've had a pretty good experience. The lounge in Amsterdam Emirates shares with other airlines is nothing to write home about. The A380 is a marvellous machine, though the seat arrangement is not couple friendly if you want to sit next to a window. You can only sit together in the middle rows. The service and the food were as expected. The sky bar is a fantastic gimmick except if you want to sleep with your seat close to the bar. Choose a seat away from the bar if you want quiet. Our connecting flight departed from Terminal C which we did not particularly like. Lots of construction going on. The Emirates Lounge offers less amenities than the one in Terminal B. However, the food selection was excellent. The Dubai to Mumbai leg was a bit of a letdown. The plane looked rather old. The age of the airliner was particularly evident in the entertainment system. The screen resolution was that of the past decade, so underwhelming. The remote control still had a phone on one side which says it all. The service and the breakfast served were good however. After this experience we were worried that for the return leg to Dubai again and old 777-300ER would be used. Additionally, web check-in did not work and our hotel only reached their Mumbai office after trying all day. We did not know whether we would be seated together until we arrived at Mumbai airport. To our pleasent surprise we were seated together and the plane was much newer with excellent screens, the separate iPad and the remote control that looks like a Playstation portable. The range of Entertainment programs Emirates' ICE system offers is fabulous. We used the lounge in Terminal B which is superior to the one in Terminal C. An absolute highlight is the Moet and Chandon bar. Very friendly staff. The last leg from Dubai to Amsterdam was again an excellent experience with good food and friendly service. The limousine transfer worked well. However, the communcation skills of the limousine service center in Mumbai could be improved.

✅ Trip Verified |  I flew overnight Birmingham to Dubai then 1hour 30min stopver before flight to Melbourne. Upon arriving in Dubai I checked the board and saw Emirates flight to Melbourne leaving from gate x so I headed to gate x. Then I checked another board and it said gate z for Emirates flight to Melbourne. I figured that gate had changed and headed to gate z. When boarding was happening for Emirates flight to Melbourne at gate z they informed me I had missed my flight which left from gate x. They were very rude and said I had to go to the Emirates connections counter. They informed me that there were 2 Emirates flights to Melbourne  leaving an hour apart and I had gone to the wrong gate. I also discovered that Dubai airport had a new policy (6 months) of no flight boarding announcements or for late passengers so they can have a nice quiet airport where passengers miss their flights. I said to the Emirates staff that they had a duty of care to inform me at check in that there was 2 flights leaving to Melbourne so I wouldn't miss my flight. Another Emirates staff admitted to me that passengers miss this flight to Melbourne every day because of this 2 flight situation. Emirates would not change my ticket as well as Qantas who sold the original ticket (Airline partnership situation) so I had to buy a new ticket for that leg £440. So in summary Emirates knew passengers miss this flight everyday because of the unusual situation of 2 Emirates Melbourne flights leaving Dubai each day within 1 hour yet they choose not the inform their passengers at check in of this situation so they can daily double charge their passengers.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Bali to Amsterdam via Dubai. I travelled with Emirates Back and fourth to Bali during the Christmas holiday. My experience of the flight was ok, but my experience with the transport of baggage and the customer service was the worst I have ever experienced. I go on a surf trip 3-4 times a year and I always pack my board the same way with allot of bubble wrapper, towels, pillows and a good board bag and I have never had any problems. On the trip down when I unpacked my board I had a few cracks that I had to fix. I called Emirates, and a very rude customer service member said that someone would call me up, of course no one did. But lesson learned. On my way back I packed my board even more carefully and added a fragile sign on the bag. To my chock when I packed up my board on arrival in Amsterdam, it was completely destroyed and rendered it useless. I called Emirates who refuse to take this matter on the telephone but told me they wont cover anything but I could send them a mail. Which I did. In the email I pointed to according to the Montreal convention they are responsible for any damage they cause on the baggage. The response was very simple. ""we are sorry for the broken board but we can and wont do anything about it, and we will not answer any more enquiries regarding this matter"" I have emailed them many times after that but the refuse to answer. My friend travelling to Copenhagen also got his board destroyed and same horrible treatment by Emirates. That’s why I write this review, I want to warn everybody to travel with Emirates! As long as you pay and shut up there is no problem but when they have caused a problem they wont do anything about it.

"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Fort Lauderdale to Casablanca via Dubai. For the longest time, I had wanted to fly Emirates, I was curious by its ads claiming to be the best economy airline in the world. In fact, about 2 years ago, I had the chance to travel to Dubai and visit Emirates training centre, where we toured the facilities, it all looked very impressive and glamorously chic. I could not wait to experience all the glamour they so advertised. I get to the counter to check in and I was expecting luxury, beautiful people in Emirates fashion, just like advertised, reality was far off as clerks at counter were just plain Janes, no problem at all, just felt cheated. Finally, boarding time came, and I was so anxious to get on board. As I get thru the plane’s door, I suddenly realize, is this a joke? Did I step into the wrong plane? Where is all the bedazzle, all the luxury, all the hype Emirates told me I should expect? As I walk thru first class, business class and finally economy, I am hit with the realization of stepping into an old aircraft, that is outdated and challenged in sophistication, style and leg room. Delta, United or American Airlines would have offered the same experience, so what makes Emirates the best economy airline in the world? This was scheduled to be a 14 + hour flight from Fort Lauderdale to Dubai, can’t Emirates use the most comfortable, newest aircrafts for these long-haul flights instead of using aircrafts that should only be used for local or short flights? Emirates certainly does not think so. Employee’s presentation, another let down, no gorgeous counter or on-board flight attendants which left a lot to be desired, not all smiles here, far from the gorgeous look I was expecting. Cabin service was a let down as well, for a 14-hour flight, I would have expected more than just dinner (when dinner was served, I had the Szechuan chicken, it was tasteless). Breakfast, a wine selection and at least a couple of snack offerings throughout the 14-hour flight, we had to get up and ask for water several times. Overall my first experience flying with Emirates was nothing as expected, it was just as underwhelming as flying with any other average airline in the market. I will say that Emirates has a brilliant marketing strategy, unfortunately, it took one time flying with them to debunk all the hype and to make me want to fly Delta or American internationally, again.",9,2018-02-11,United States,True,flew fort lauderdale casablanca via dubai longest time wanted fly emirate curious ad claiming best economy airline world fact year ago chance travel dubai visit emirate training centre toured facility looked impressive glamorously chic could wait experience glamour advertised get counter check expecting luxury beautiful people emirate fashion like advertised reality far clerk counter plain janes problem felt cheated finally boarding time came anxious get board get thru plane door suddenly realize joke step wrong plane bedazzle luxury hype emirate told expect walk thru first class business class finally economy hit realization stepping old aircraft outdated challenged sophistication style leg room delta united american airline would offered experience make emirate best economy airline world scheduled hour flight fort lauderdale dubai emirate use comfortable newest aircraft long haul flight instead using aircraft used local short flight emirate certainly think employee presentation another let gorgeous counter board flight attendant left lot desired smile far gorgeous look expecting cabin service let well hour flight would expected dinner dinner served szechuan chicken tasteless breakfast wine selection least couple snack offering throughout hour flight get ask water several time overall first experience flying emirate nothing expected underwhelming flying average airline market say emirate brilliant marketing strategy unfortunately took one time flying debunk hype make want fly delta american internationally
"✅ Trip Verified |  Cairo to Bangkok via Dubai. Don't get fooled once you see an attractive ticket price, as those attractive prices have a dark side in the T&C, especially when you are dealing with a big airline like emirates, so they never solve the problem once it happens, and you start getting bullied by their complaint department. You will be surprised after all the marketing they do and ads, and they have those monsters in their back office! what even make it worst, is that I am a regular customer since 2008 & I am on their skyward mileage reward, with a very good/strong history but still wasn't enough, and they unleashed those complaint team on me. I bought a ticket with a stopover in Dubai, and I wanted to extend my trip for only 1 day more, so I went to their office and was notified that there is a condition in my ticket which doesn't allow me to stay 1 more day (Max 7 days), and if I want to stay then I have to pay several penalties which ends me up with paying almost the same price I paid for the 1st ticket! So I asked the guy to check if I buy a new 1 way ticket on the same date and surprisingly it was half the price of those penalties they wanted to apply on me! So I submitted a complaint, and  asked if there is a solution, as simply the penalties doesn't make any sense especially when the 1 way ticket is half the price of the penalty, and I also mentioned that who has the time to read the T&C unless he/she has nothing to do in the world, and I ended up my complaint with some cute pressure that if there is no solution, then I would like to cancel my skyward. The complaint department replied with we know that you read the T&C and we should apply those conditions on you, and there's no way out and please confirm that you want to cancel your skyward so we start processing the cancelation! They left me with no solution except checking 1 way ticket back.

"✅ Trip Verified | My daughter has travelled with Emirates a couple of times and had excellent experiences and hence recommended me to take Emirates to fly back to India from the US. I was travelling alone and my daughter had booked wheelchair assistance for my entire itinerary. I suffer from varicose veins and also had recently injured my knee, both added up causing unbearable pain. I was offered wheelchair assistance at DTW (Michigan) airport where I boarded the flight and my daughter went home relieved that I would be provided wheelchair assistance for the rest of my itinerary. However, I was left in the lurch when I arrived in Boston airport to board flight to Bangalore via Dubai. I had very little time left to board the flight and had to push myself to walk fast with the unbearable pain. This continued in Dubai airport as once again there was no wheelchair assistance provided in Dubai. I somehow managed this time as I had two hours twenty minutes to board the next flight.

"✅ Trip Verified | Emirates service has really gone down in the last few years. Probably, it has resulted from the cost-cutting measures they had to take. It's competition Qatar Airways has, on the other hand, improved quite a lot and even Etihad has better service on some parameters. On my last trip I observed the following: 1) The flight was delayed from 4.10 to 4.40 from India according to the announcement but the flight actually started boarding at 5. Because of this most of us were running for our connecting flights in Dubai. 2) At least 10 passengers when reaching Zurich couldn't find their luggage and we hope to get it tomorrow. 3) They recently introduced a 20kg limit on international flights for the economy class. What a good way to surprise customers and make more money. 4) I cannot explain how rude the staff were. 5) The toilets were not clean and the body lotion was not refilled. 6) Headphones were not working and they had to change it twice for me.

Emirates has 2 gates (42 and 44) and 4 air bridges to load the plane, yet the affair was poorly managed and far beneath a quality airline. The attendant at the boarding gate lounge screened every boarding pass and sent various zones away to ‘take a seat’ (when there aren’t any seats near the gates). Perhaps use of a sign or 2 would be wise. Perhaps Emirates you can find a way to load a plane through 2 lounges without treating the passengers as inconvenient cattle. The staff gave poor instructions and were cranky with the crowd. Comments like ‘you’ll all get on’ shouldn’t be needed.

So I decided to go to the galley to get it myself. Where I was met by a cabin staff who initially refused to serve me but she started to question me why do I wanted the drink now ? What reason?

"✅ Trip Verified |  Hamburg to Mumbai via Dubai. Emirates has been long projecting themselves as a premium airline but things have gone down the drain. While making online check-in, they only provide to reserve seats in the middle (check the attached picture). Aisle seats are basically reserved for higher class of Economy. This is unacceptable because it should be based on first come first serve basis. That's one of the reason why passengers do online check-in! For the return flight, aircraft was very light but the check-in staff was extremely stingy in regards with luggage. I was 3 kgs more than limit and when I pointed out the Emirates Online Published Baggage Policy that luggage ""not exceeding"" 32 kgs"", the staff abruptly replied ""this policy is only for US bound passengers"". But this is not mentioned anywhere. Clearly she was dodging the rule. It seemed more like, she has been instructed to shell out money. After after security check, the manager still wanted to weigh hand luggage before final boarding. Even after boarding and settling down, the manager came on-board to give us final notice that they might conduct a surprise check of hand luggage and have to pay double if found guilty. This was definitely the height! Honestly, I couldn't believe she made this announcement. On 3 out 4 flights, they served absolutely the same food, I couldn't see it anymore, forget about eating it. The staff was of mixed bag ranging between ""okay and poor"" with ""forced to work and doing a favour"" attitude.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Glasgow to Auckland via Dubai. Emirates fell very short of their much hyped quality service on the flight from Dubai to Auckland on 26 Dec 2017. I had the misfortune to fly with them from Dubai to Auckland. The ground staff were very rude and unhelpful in Dubai, it took an age to get our boarding passes checked and when I did eventually get to my allotted seat I found someone else sitting there with exactly the same boarding pass!! the airplane was pushing back for take off while I was still standing in the galley while the air crew were trying to find me a seat! what does that say about their Health and safety and security. Anyhow the killer was that after the 17 hour flight to Auckland we had to queue an extra 3 hours in the airport to record the fact that our bags had not arrived. In fact approximately 150 bags didn't make it to Auckland so there were massive queues. Emirates ground staff were totally unprepared despite the fact that Emirates knew for at least 17 hours that our bags would not arrive at the same time as us! They wasted a day of my holiday and limited what I could do on the following day as I had to be available to sign for the bags when they were eventually delivered. We were not the most inconvenienced passengers. There were others who missed their connection to south island and several people in wheelchairs also waiting in a queue for 3 hours with no refreshments offered or seating to help those less able to stand. Any organisation that was serious about delivering a quality service would have had sufficient staff available to process our basic details so that the missing luggage could be delivered and would have had seating refreshments for those who needed it. Whilst things can go wrong its how you deal with the mishaps that determines whether you deliver a quality service. I received no apology or compensation to make up for the inconvenience and loss of a days holiday caused by Emirates failure. so many lessons could be learned from this but I doubt it will. This cant be the first time they have had such a massive failure in the delivery of luggage. I've flown several times with Emirates and had to put up with everything from missed connections to having give up my seat so that the drunk the passenger next to me could be physically restrained  (a former Emirates crew member). not once have I received a formal apology or any compensation.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Bangkok, The Emirates experience has been degrading for years.  Whereas flights of over 7 hours used to have two meals, they now have just one. Not even a snack can be spared on those flights (even all the European airlines they try to talk down do a sandwich or a snack half-way through the flight).

"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Hong Kong. Emirates has changed the configuration of its daily Bangkok/Hong Kong return flight from 3 class to a reduced business class and substantially increased economy class. This results in a total of 615 passengers. The problem is that it is the front half of the upper deck that has been given over to economy resulting in premium passengers having to wait till these have disembarked before they can get off. Since lower deck passengers are also disembarking earlier, a quick exit to Immigration is now out of the question! Almost all other A380 operators more sensibly put the extra economy seats at the back of the upper deck. That said, Emirates service remains excellent. The Bangkok lounge offers a wide range of food and drink. On board hot towels are lightly scented and lunch menus have a choice of 3 entrees and superb wines. The bar offers premium liquors and many different canapés for those not wishing the full meal. I just have two slightly negative comments about the on-board service. With the reduced business class it would be nice if an after take-off drink is offered. Frequently one has to wait for up to 45 minutes for the meal service to start before any drinks are brought round. Secondly, despite the huge variety of entertainment offered, I still find the revised entertainment programme guide a total design mess. It is impossible to find out if movies are comedies/dramas/action etc. Worse, the guide provides no timings, so you have no idea if you have enough time to watch a full movie. The only way to check length is by wasting time loading each individual movie.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Delhi to New York via Dubai. I departed New Delhi and on reaching Dubai, I had a 2 hour layover. I had a sore throat and a cough while traveling so I went straight to the gate to request for a window seat and explained my condition to them but they denied my request. Over time, my health deteriorated a little more. When I went up to the gate staff to talk to them again, they called the medics to get me checked. The medics said I was okay to travel but at this point, the gate supervisor demanded for a doctor's note to ensure I was okay to fly. I don't understand why they needed a doctor's note when we the medics said okay. Anyway, I tried to convince the supervisor because it was incredibly important for me to get back to New York on Tuesday morning as I had some important meetings lined up. They refused. I was taken to the doctor which was one building away, and given some medicine. The doctor gave me a note in no time and I was sent back to the gate without any assistance. They took me to the hospital on the airport hospital shuttle but I was made to walk back in that condition. It took me 20 minutes to walk back to the gate to find the supervisor, who had told me I would be moved to the next flight instead once I have the doctor's note. There was no one at the gate and I was directed to the ticketing counter. After waiting the long line, they asked me to pay for my new flight, which I refused to do. First off, being a college student, I did not the money to pay for another ticket. Secondly, it wasn't my decision to not board the previous flight. The gate staff decided on my behalf and I shouldn't be made to pay for a decision they made. I tried to explain my situation to the person at ticketing but they were no help and asked me to wait another hour to see the manager, because there was a shift change apparently and they said I couldn't be helped. I finally got to see the manager and she directed me to the PRO office and said it wasn't in her hands. I walked to the PRO office and begged for help because at that point, I felt vulnerable. I was exhausted and hadn't sleep in over 24 hours. They kept stalling me and sending me to different authorities.  I waited until 7 and then finally the PROs called me in only to tell me I had to pay 740 AED for a flight change and that's all they can do. I felt emotionally drained so I did whatever they said to just get back home.  As a consequence, I missed my flight from JFK to ROC which I had to rebook at an extra cost. I always loved flying with Emirates but this trip was very disappointing.

✅ Trip Verified | A disappointing experience. Flew with Emirates on the A380 from Christchurch to Sydney. Had high expectations from my previous flight. Emirates have a fantastic hard product on the A380. Great spacious seat and fantastic entertainment systems. The food onboard the flight was great with a great selection of onboard beverages and well-presented meals. I was very disappointed by the crew and received dull and uninterested service. The staff seemed to have no interest in the guests traveling. The service was efficient but cold. Certainly room for improvement for a so-called leading airline. I would not recommend Emirates if traveling in business class. There are alternative airlines that with great products and personalized service where you will have a more well rounded experience.,7,2018-01-21,New Zealand,True,disappointing experience flew emirate christchurch sydney high expectation previous flight emirate fantastic hard product great spacious seat fantastic entertainment system food onboard flight great great selection onboard beverage well presented meal disappointed crew received dull uninterested service staff seemed interest guest traveling service efficient cold certainly room improvement called leading airline would recommend emirate traveling business class alternative airline great product personalized service well rounded experience

Flight 229, Dubai to Seattle. I last flew Emirates business class two years ago and it was good. Since then, quality has severely declined. The aircraft for this flight was - according to the attendant - 15 days old. They attendants didn’t know how to use the seats. The seats themselves we not much wider than economy class. Though they were lie-flat seats, the seats were “cupped” so you sunk into the middle when you lie them flat. Uncomfortable! This could have been softened by an attentive and helpful staff member however even getting water was difficult. The flight attendants didn’t offer anything between breakfast and lunch nor between lunch and dinner. For business class, this is completely unacceptable. I had to ask several times just for water. When I said thank you, they did not even say 'you’re welcome'. Really awful.",5,2018-01-18,United States,True,flight dubai seattle last flew emirate business class two year ago good since quality severely declined aircraft flight according attendant day old attendant know use seat seat much wider economy class though lie flat seat seat cupped sunk middle lie flat uncomfortable could softened attentive helpful staff member however even getting water difficult flight attendant offer anything breakfast lunch lunch dinner business class completely unacceptable ask several time water said thank even say welcome really awful

As a UK citizen what would be my immigration status be etc? The agent refused to help me on the grounds that the flight delay/cancellation was due to extraordinary circumstances. His words were ""You are on your own on this one. You can go to Singapore if you like, that is very nice.""

"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Bangkok via Dubai. We were scheduled to fly out of Manchester airport on Wednesday 20th December at 20.35. On check in we noticed that the flight time had been changed to around 21.10. We were not notified of any changes and the Emirates staff who checked us in gave us no explanation as to why this had been moved. After being in the airport a couple of hours we then noticed our flight had been further delayed. We were meant to arrive into Dubai international at 07.45 for our flight to Bangkok at 09.35, so the fact that the flight was delayed made us worry as we did not know whether we would make our connection flight. As a result we contacted our travel agent at Flight centre about our concern whilst in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. They called Emirates to raise the alarm that if there was a delay we would struggle to make a connection flight. We eventually boarded our flight and left Manchester almost two hours late and arrived in Dubai at 09.12. On the aircraft the captain told us that we were delayed due to the Emirates plane leaving Dubai late. We missed our flight, we had no apologies and the only option to get us to Bangkok in time for the 07.30 flight was to fly at 16.00 to Mumbai with Emirates and then a flight to Bangkok with Thai airways. This would land us at around 05.00 and in the meantime we would have a hotel room and lunch. We had to take this option but were not happy as this would mean we would lose our money on the hotel in Bangkok and our dinner reservation. However, the flight to Mumbai landed late, which caused us more anxiety then the flight to Bangkok took off late so we landed with under two hours till our next flight. I am extremely disappointed with the service I received with Emirates. The unexplained delays, unhelpful and rude staff in some cases, as well as missing our night in Bangkok was just not good enough. We were travelling for over 36 hours to Bangkok when we should have been there over 12 hours earlier. Whilst we appreciate that Emirates put us onto alternative flights to get to Bangkok we should have already been on the 11:45 flight as soon as our travel agent had contacted whilst we were still in Manchester.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Dhaka via Athens and Dubai and back to Newark via same routes. Dreamed about these long haul flights, but got very disappointed - what has happened to Emirates? No longer the comfortable journeys I had enjoyed previously. Service extremely poor and chaotic. No air hostess seemed to care in spite of pointing out several times. Disappointed to find no pre-dinner drinks or appetizers, but only a good-looking menu with a list of fancy items - not so delicious to eat, unfortunately. They missed serving me dinner while most of my fellow passengers were enjoying theirs. Had to call an exhausted air hostess twice, but all in vain. Got my dinner after 30 min when all my co-passengers finished eating. Drinks were very sparse, not offered more than once, coffees were cold and tasteless, and most foods were poor and stale - mostly carbohydrate-heavy with almost no green salads. Not the best airline for service I have flown with for some time across the oceans. On my return flights an online offer popped up during the online check-in to upgrade to business class, but I got to upgrade for the first leg of the journey only - not the entire route as the offer disappeared on my second try (it gave me only one chance to upgrade). Not impressed with the business class kit-bag or other amenities. Couldn't sleep in the modernized recliner at all. Free business class lounge uses at Dubai airport were not offered in spite of buying an upgrade. I am sorry for Emirates that used to be one of the rare 5 star airlines. From Dubai to Athens to Newark, the rest of the journey was more like you would expect from a budget airline.

"✅ Trip Verified | Dubai to Colombo. Emirates stand as my preferred choice and the reason I pen these lines is to draw attention to a trend that seems to be slowly creeping in and lowering the standard. I travel economy as I have a back problem and feel more comfortable in the small harder seat sitting straight through a flight. My ticket was purchased in economy, I subsequently received a mail to state that I had been specially selected for an upgrade on a small payment. I did this only to offer the seat to my son, I later realized that most of the passengers had received the same message. This is actually a rip off as if I were to have bought a CCL ticket directly it would have cost me AED 3035/- here with the ug's it ended up a little more but minus the CCL benefits. Baggage, limo and lounge. Unlike several years ago when the crew looked stunning and of a better background today they seem to be quite poorly behind the uniform. Gone is that poise and flare. On my return journey the crew managed to tick me off with her carelessness and rudeness. If I had never travelled Emirates before it may have been my last.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Birmingham via Dubai. We flew on an overnight A380 Emirates flight from Brisbane to Dubai in late September, leaving Brisbane late at night. Flying time was 14 hours 20 minutes non-stop. This was sleeping time - I thought. I paid the extra $55 to select seats in economy for my wife and myself. I boarded and sat down to our long haul flight on a seat that was already broken. The recline wouldn’t lock in, and made an awful clunking noise whenever I moved the seat back or forward. After a few hours I had worked out that if I pushed back hard and held on with my feet and my back I could get the seat to recline. But as soon as I let the pressure off it immediately sprung back – in fact it sprung back past normal upright. You can imagine the result - 14 hours plus of long haul discomfort, battling with this seat! Naturally I couldn’t keep it up for the whole flight, and so after a few hours I sat upright – or past upright. Given that the seat in front was fully reclined, while mine was leaning forward, I couldn’t even put my head on the tray table. I mentioned the problem to the Emirates staff on board, but nothing could be done as it was a full flight, they said. So I left it at that. On our return home to Brisbane a month later I wrote to Emirates about the matter. They said that they would respond within 30 days, after they had gathered the facts. On day 30 I had no answer, so I prompted them for a reply. Yes, they eventually said in their response – the seat you selected was in fact broken on that flight - we knew about it as we had a logged report on it. Sorry to hear that you didn’t find the flight comfortable. (They obviously knew about the problem on the day that they received my email - but they deliberately held out responding for the full 30 days – hoping, no doubt, that I’d forget the matter.) They went on to say:- “Given that you had availed of the Advance Seat Reservation and paid AUD55.00 for the seat, we will be pleased to refund this charge to you. Kindly provide your bank details in order to process a bank transfer to your account….thank you for taking the time and trouble to write to us. ” That was it. If I had not paid $55 to select the seat – would Emirates have just written back (after 30 days) to say, sorry about your long uncomfortable flight in our broken seat, but too bad – nothing more we will do?

"✅ Trip Verified | Jakarta to London via Dubai. This is the first time I took Emirates, and definitely my last. Boarding began from Jakarta and the ground staff was courteous. In-flight, I don't really expect much because the cabin crew is generally not willing to go out of their way to get you your cup of coffee, especially on a busy morning flight. The cabin looks and feel tight, though I am neither tall nor fat. The seats? It isn't worth commenting. Landing in Dubai for the transit to London, expect the usual UAE approach.

"✅ Trip Verified | London to Islamabad via Dubai. This was probably my worst experience ever with any airline I have ever traveled with. On my flight from London to Dubai, I was asked to move my stuff from my hand-carry to my check-in baggage and was charged a lot for the extra weight in my checked-in bag. Later, I had a layover at Dubai airport before my final destination. Just before boarding, the person at the gate charged me more than 150$ for my hand-carry again, when I told him specifically that I was charged at the London airport to move the weight to my checked in bag. The staff was extremely rude and apparently were even charging people who bought stuff from the duty-free shop. It seemed like Emirates was in desperate need of some extra cash. Since the flight was about to depart, nobody could really do much. There was a lot of anger and frustration. I was charged twice for almost the amount of a new ticket, and it did not make any sense. I am still unable to understand why and how the hand-carry at London airport that met the weight need (especially after moving the stuff to the checked in bag and paying for it) was charged again at the Dubai airport? In short, this really was my last time to choose Emirates to fly with. I am extremely disappointed in an airline that used to be one of my favorites.

In their own words “ I must point out that Emirates hand baggage allowance for Economy class passengers has always been one piece not exceeding 7kgs. Naturally, we allow reasonable quantities of duty free goods in addition to the above, however it would appear that the total weight off your hand luggage when reporting at the gate for your flight was exceeding your allowance”.

"✅ Trip Verified | My business journey from Germany to India took me more than 38 hours, thanks to a not acceptable miss from Emirates. Starting Sunday 10th December in Frankfurt/Germany I finally arrived Tuesday morining at 5 am in Hyderabad/India. For those who don´t know - this flight usually takes not more than 14 hours. It all started with a delay due to weather-conditions in Frankfurt. Well things like this happen, but sitting for more than two hours in the plane waiting for de-icing, Emirates weren't able to serve even a glass of water to passengers. The flight itself to Dubai was ok. In order to get the connecting flight to Hyderabad/India my colleagues and me were running through the airport and finally reached the gate right on time. Everything went fine, we even managed to be at the gate more than 30 min before gate-closing - that was my thought. Here the nightmare begins: At the check-in counter the supervisor told us that our seats had been already given away without any further explanation. This is something I can't understand, I also know from another colleague sitting on the plane that the flight even had free seats (in business as well as in economy). The supervisor told us to go to the customer service counter to raise our issue and clarify how to move on. This happens around 3 am in the morning. Obviously we were not the only one, there was a long lane of passengers at the counter. We were forced to wait more than 2 hours in a line, standing on our feet without seeing any Emirates-employees offering us water, food or just some friendly words. At their home-hub in Dubai? At this point in time around 5.30 in the morning, we were already tired and exhausted. After a long explanation to the service-employee, we managed to get a hotel and an alternative flight for the next evening. In order to check-in into the hotel we need to immigrate to Dubai (another 30min of waiting at immigration) and get a hotel voucher (another 30min of waiting at another Emirates counter). Than the hotel-shuttle was overbooked as well so we pay a taxi out of our pocket to get to the hotel. Next several misses. 7 am in the morning, we got welcomed by a long lane of grounded passengers waiting at the counter to check-in. Two hours later at 9 am in the morning I finally enter my room try to get some sleep. Summary: On a long distance journey things can take a turn for the worse due to delays and this is quite normal. But: I can't understand why they acted like this. There was no apology and the inconvenience was tremendously high. This was my first experience with Emirates and at the moment I am not looking forward for the flight back to Germany.",3,2017-12-14,Germany,True,business journey germany india took hour thanks acceptable miss emirate starting sunday th december frankfurt germany finally arrived tuesday morining hyderabad india know flight usually take hour started delay due weather condition frankfurt well thing like happen sitting two hour plane waiting de icing emirate able serve even glass water passenger flight dubai ok order get connecting flight hyderabad india colleague running airport finally reached gate right time everything went fine even managed gate min gate closing thought nightmare begin check counter supervisor told u seat already given away without explanation something understand also know another colleague sitting plane flight even free seat business well economy supervisor told u go customer service counter raise issue clarify move happens around morning obviously one long lane passenger counter forced wait hour line standing foot without seeing emirate employee offering u water food friendly word home hub dubai point time around morning already tired exhausted long explanation service employee managed get hotel alternative flight next evening order check hotel need immigrate dubai another min waiting immigration get hotel voucher another min waiting another emirate counter hotel shuttle overbooked well pay taxi pocket get hotel next several miss morning got welcomed long lane grounded passenger waiting counter check two hour later morning finally enter room try get sleep summary long distance journey thing take turn worse due delay quite normal understand acted like apology inconvenience tremendously high first experience emirate moment looking forward flight back germany

I decided to take a couple of pictures and videos of the same to show the look of the lounge to my family. But an Indian flight attendant really rudely asked me to stop clicking pictures and said that if any crew member has been clicked to delete my videos as I can get involved into legal matters. This was embarrassing and humiliating for me as other crew members and passengers could hear this and started staring at us. He would not be wrong in saying this to me but there is a way of requesting for something. I went back to my seat and sat there for a while.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Birmingham to Nairobi via Dubai. First problem was on checking in. I thought I might be one Kg over but imagine my surprise when I was told I was 6kg over! I had thought that my laptop was separate from my hand luggage allowance. In 2015 when I traveled on the same airline I got 46kg allowance. The clerk said I would have to pay excess baggage. I asked to speak to her supervisor and he said that was right, I’d have to pay. ‘Magnanimously’ he reduced the charge to half, 3kilos, which was £126. This is a right royal ripoff as I regularly send air parcels to Kenya for £4.25 per kilo.  I could not afford to leave any goods behind as I was traveling by myself. I was furious and paid the £126. One would think Emirates would want happy customers, but after paying £700 for my ticket and £1000 for my wife to follow me next week I was far from happy. Need to look next time I fly to an alternative airline. To be honest I’ve never found Birmingham Emirates check in very friendly, I feel like I’m being tolerated, not valued. Well the flight was no better, took off late and food took three hours to be served from takeoff, I’m a diabetic and starting to feel quite unwell by the time I got a choice of only one main course which is the usual mushy tray of stew-like substance. Dubai airport is nice but it’s a long trek to the gate followed by a long bus ride to the terminal. Food was again usual poor fare and just before landing a passengber sitting close to me vomited all over himself and he just sat there comatose. I assume he had been drinking before/during the flight and was blotto. There was no apology from cabin staff and although many passengers were retching from the smell onboard, no air fresher was brought by stewardesses!

"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Mumbai via Dubai. Comfortable, clean and modern aircraft. In flight entertainment excellent. Food was decent and warm. Customer care is poor. The flight crew are running around doing whatever they feel. Most of the time they are sitting in the middle talking to each other. I have been flying internationally for last 15 years and this was the first time a crew member got upset when I made a request for water. In between meals no beverage provided. Even when meal service was being done, one of the stewardess rushed past everyone so that no one could order. This airline is not worth your money. Please spend a few more bucks and go to Qatar Airways where you will be respected as a human being or go cheap on Etihad as they are worth what you pay. Emirates no longer cares about its customers.

"✅ Trip Verified | The chauffeur service (always a Mercedes) and lounge provided in Delhi was great. The flight from Delhi to Dubai was uneventful at 4am except that the steward was helpful and smiling most of the time. That was a delight which was dampened by a remote bay arrival into busy Dubai. The lounge in Concourse A helps you board directly from the gate which is great. It is not as good though as the lounge in Concourse B. The flight to Toronto featured a new business class cabin on the upper deck with no overhead bins on the window side. The flight was full and the flight attendant, although tired at the fag end of 14 hours could not do enough. The bar was a superb place to hang out when I was tired sitting on the seat - and this leads to being overfed on even a long haul flight - you cannot stop picking at snacks at the bar. I did feel the seat/bed was a bit too tight (even though I am a relatively smaller person). The food and IFE continues to be outstanding. Also wifi is free for business class passengers and I was connected inflight almost all along. Arrival at Toronto airport was fuss free and it is a however a bit difficult to locate the chauffeur service at exit.

"✅ Trip Verified | I have been flying with Emirates for 6 years as they offered good customer service, and did not sell exit row seats. No longer it seems. I recently booked a flight from London to Denpasar via Dubai, only to find after paying for the flight that Emirates now charge for exit row seats, in this case an additional £150. I immediately called Emirates to discuss this to see if anything could be done. The representative said my options were to pay for the seats, pay a £100 cancellation fee or email customer services. I emailed customer services highlighting that it is poor customer service and even worse business process to not show the potential full price of the flight until after the customer has booked and requested a fair and reasonable solution. The representative said my options were to pay for the seats or pay a £100 cancellation fee. Shame Emirates. Emirates did not show the full price and are using a misleading process that sells a ticket without showing the potential full price.

"✅ Trip Verified | Emirates appear to be upgrading a lot of Economy passengers to Business. At check in the Business Class was only partially occupied on the Madrid-Dubai segment, indeed a few days before check in occupation was very sparse. On the day of travel it was almost full. So where did all the passengers suddenly appear from? I can only guess that they were upgrades, unless Emirates are bulk selling Business seats at lower prices through bucket shops. In either case, it seems extremely unfair on people like myself who have paid full price out of our own pocket, since the service for so many passengers is obviously not as good and why should I have to pay three times as much as my neighbour for the same seat? To add insult to injury, Madrid and Barcelona are Emirates' most expensive business class departures cities in Europe. Example Madrid Australia return is 5000 euros + from Madrid but less than 4000 euros from Paris or London.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Auckland Due to a medical emergency on the incoming flight from Dubai, the flight from Melbourne to Auckland was delayed by 4 hours. Emirates did sent a text message well ahead of the originally scheduled departure so there was no need to rush to the airport.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Zurich to Melbourne via Dubai. I was punctually picked-up by the chauffeur drive service, and had a smooth check-in and quick transfer through customs & security to the lounge. Boarding commenced on time and I was welcomed by a very friendly and helpful cabin crew. The crew was very attentive and provided excellent service throughout a full and very busy flight. My window seat was very comfortable with lots of legroom and also a small little mini bar with soft drinks, which were replenished throughout the flight. The food offered on board was excellent and Emirates' wine list is of very high quality. Both food and wine offerings were very generous. The inflight entertainment system is the best and has a fantastic selection of movies, shows and music. The A380 is a wonderful plane to fly in, very quiet, spacious and the bar of course is one of the highlights. Overall, I had a great flight. After a 3 hour break I was due to board the connecting flight to Melbourne. Fog in Dubai though caused a delay but we were kept well informed by ground staff and once boarding started it was smooth. The A380 cabin as well as the service in this very busy flight (full business class) was again fabulous. Maybe just something trivial, but I loved that one could adjust the window blinds individually by pressing the respective buttons.

"✅ Trip Verified | Not close to what we expected. We now understand why Emirates is not number 1 anymore. We are frequent travellers going to various locations, always Economy.

On all flights we were pretty confused that the blankets we used to keep us warm were taken away before landing, same counts for the earphones. (We had our own but even them they wanted to take away, crazy). The Cabin crew was not pretty helpful and especially soft drinks were not offered often enough, even on request we were simply ignored, maybe because of being Economy guests.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Bangkok via Dubai. I understood from the crew that Emirates has a new policy to overbook the economy class and upgrade all remaining passengers to Business class. That is what happened on the both mentioned flights, more than 50% passengers got free upgrades to Business. So C class was totally full on the huge A380 results in poor service because the FAs were totally overloaded with this high amount of people. On the flight from Frankfurt to Dubai I had to wait more than 3 hours until they served the dinner. Further I think this is also very unfair for the passengers who paid the business class fare.

"✅ Trip Verified |  Zürich to Phuket via Dubai. I had high expectations since I  heard that Emirates should be very good, but I was very disappointed. The customer service was terrible. I am not sure they even know what it means. The stewardesses had a very arrogant, superior attitude which I found just low and disgusting. As they went down the aisle they went with hard steps as if they wanted all attention on themselves. One time a stewardess was serving drinks and as she presented the tablet with the drinks, my boyfriend wanted to take the tray to make it easier to take our drinks. Then she said in not such a friendly tone; ""Just take the drinks please."" Not politeness, no smile. I don't know if they are able to smile, because we didn't see much of it. They may think that the red lipstick makes them look nice, but a smile is way more beautiful. Another time a stewardess was serving food and drinks and as she came to our row I looked up. Then she said in an arrogant tone; ""Hold on please"", then walked away and came back a little later. I hadn't said anything to her. At the end of a flight a man came to collect all the headphones. I gave mine to my boyfriend so he could give it, because he sat by the aisle. He gave it to the man and a little later the man asked for the headphones, not in a nice way and with no smile. My boyfriend then told him he had already given it. He just looked and then went on. No apology, which one would actually expect. When you work in the service business you cannot act all arrogant and superior, because then you lose customers which you are dependent on to receive salary. They obviously didn't learn what I learned as I was working in the service business. That the customer is the boss. Another thing was that as we boarded the plane, it reeked of perfume, which was just very nauseating to be honest. Very disappointing was also on the flight from Dubai to Phuket as my boyfriend and I didn't get to sit together even though we had booked as a couple. We were told that if there were some available seats in the back that we could maybe sit together. The stewardess never came. My boyfriend then saw that there were some available seats in the back and we asked a stewardess if we could sit there. Then she said that no, these seats are for the cabin crew to sit down for breaks. Uhm, what? I have never experienced that the cabin crew is sitting with the rest of the passengers. So this was very odd. The food was ok, the entertainment was not to be complained about, but the rude, unfriendly, arrogant cabin crew just ruined everything for me. I have this to say to those arrogant stewardesses; ""Get over yourselves and get down from your high horse, you are not better than anyone."" So I will not be travelling with Emirates again, and I will certainly not recommend it to anyone I know, quite the contrary actually.",8,2017-11-24,Switzerland,True,z rich phuket via dubai high expectation since heard emirate good disappointed customer service terrible sure even know mean stewardess arrogant superior attitude found low disgusting went aisle went hard step wanted attention one time stewardess serving drink presented tablet drink boyfriend wanted take tray make easier take drink said friendly tone take drink please politeness smile know able smile see much may think red lipstick make look nice smile way beautiful another time stewardess serving food drink came row looked said arrogant tone hold please walked away came back little later said anything end flight man came collect headphone gave mine boyfriend could give sat aisle gave man little later man asked headphone nice way smile boyfriend told already given looked went apology one would actually expect work service business cannot act arrogant superior lose customer dependent receive salary obviously learn learned working service business customer bos another thing boarded plane reeked perfume nauseating honest disappointing also flight dubai phuket boyfriend get sit together even though booked couple told available seat back could maybe sit together stewardess never came boyfriend saw available seat back asked stewardess could sit said seat cabin crew sit break uhm never experienced cabin crew sitting rest passenger odd food ok entertainment complained rude unfriendly arrogant cabin crew ruined everything say arrogant stewardess get get high horse better anyone travelling emirate certainly recommend anyone know quite contrary actually
"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Athens on Boeing 777-300 in Business Class. Emirates is a better airline than any US carrier but it aspires, it says, to be the best airline in the world. It is far from that.My flight was delayed due to some issue of getting our aircraft to the gate. The information about this delay was non-existent at check-in. I found out about the delay only after the agent in the SAS Lounge (who doesn't work for Emirates) told me about it.  Eventually, we were told the flight was boarding. We left to discover nothing of the sort. The gate area was chaos. The flight was not boarding, not even close. The employees, about 6 in number, were glued to their smart phones texting and surfing. I would fire every last one of them. They made infrequent and irregular announcements, with incorrect information. The boarding time kept getting moved. The employees sat on their phones. Finally, we started to board. Well, not the Premium passengers. First, the people traveling needing extra assistance and with children. Eventually, Business class boarded, but only after an Emirates person line jumped with a group of passengers in front of us. Once on board, I encountered a seat with a non-functional small video screen that is used to control the seat! Fortunately, the seat next to me was empty. The seat is not the standard these days. Angled lie flat is so 1980. Middle seats in Business Class? Are you kidding, Emirates? Whoever made this decision should be fired. The wine list contained one champagne (good selection) and two whites (one a dismal CA Chardonnay, the other a nice Sancerre) and two reds (one a pedestrian Oregon Pinot and one a 2007 Bordeaux that was quite nice). This selection pales in comparison to Qatar. Food quality was very good, although the crew wanted to rush me through the meal. I didn't let them. Eventually, they adjusted. Crew service was spotty. At times personal and nice, and at times missing or impersonal. The inflight entertainment is extensive but the system is CLUNKY to use and the endless ads before any movie is irritating beyond belief. It is also very hard to scroll quickly through the movie options. They are also poorly organized into categories, in my opinion. For the money, Qatar is a far better airline with a truly premium treatment for people in premium classes. Better seats, friendlier crews, better wine, and an overall better experience is available on Qatar.

This was agreed, confirmed and confirmed again at check in where they advised it had not been added. On boarding the aircraft when those needing time/assistance were asked to board I found myself behind at least 10 able bodied passengers jumping the queue. To add insult to injury, after getting on board, the stewardess then made me wait while one of these able bodied passengers messed around for 5 minutes. When I did get to my seat, I had spent that long standing and queuing that I was in a lot of pain. Thanks Emirates. Arriving in Dubai where I was supposed to be assisted, again there was no help and I had to struggle across the airport in pain.

"✅ Trip Verified | Unforgettable experience flying with Emirates from Singapore to Rome via Dubai. I was booked on flight EK433, with scheduled departure on Friday at 9.35am but was notified last minute via text message at 4.23am that I had been put on EK353 departing at 10.10am instead. To make things worse, that flight was delayed for another 1 hour 10 minutes. I didn’t know if I was traveling with Emirates or a budget airline that cancels flights on a whim. By the time I arrived in Dubai, my original 2 hour connection time had become less than 40 minutes. Ground staff in Dubai did not offer any form of assistance in making my connecting flight. I made it to the departure gate 5 minutes before closing time only to be told I had been offloaded from the plane. At no stage was I notified that I would be bumped from my connecting flight because of shorter than “minimum connection time” thanks to Emirates’ brilliant incompetence in punctuality. After some argument with the ground staff at the gate, I managed to get onto the flight with the supervisor granting me an act of grace, when it’s Emirates which had sinned. But his grace did not extend to my checked in baggage however, which will only arrive with the next flight. Arrangement to make delivery of my delayed baggage was made immediately after clearing immigration on arrival in Rome FCO airport Friday at 6.40pm, when I was assured my luggage would arrive following day. I even received an email saying my bag will arrive in Rome at about 12.40pm on Saturday. Little did I know I would be slapped in my face with Emirates’ commitment to punctuality again. When I haven’t received my bag at 5pm, I rang the baggage office, and was advised it had just cleared customs and would be delivered in the evening. 6 hours later I was still waiting, and followed up with another less than pleasant phone call. Upon which, the only solution they could offer is the contact number of the local baggage delivery agent.

"✅ Trip Verified | Unforgettable experience flying with Emirates from Singapore to Rome via Dubai. I was booked on flight EK433, with scheduled departure on Friday at 9.35am but was notified last minute via text message at 4.23am that I had been put on EK353 departing at 10.10am instead. To make things worse, that flight was delayed for another 1 hour 10 minutes. I didn’t know if I was traveling with Emirates or a budget airline that cancels flights on a whim. By the time I arrived in Dubai, my original 2 hour connection time had become less than 40 minutes. Ground staff in Dubai did not offer any form of assistance in making my connecting flight. I made it to the departure gate 5 minutes before closing time only to be told I had been offloaded from the plane. At no stage was I notified that I would be bumped from my connecting flight because of shorter than “minimum connection time” thanks to Emirates’ brilliant incompetence in punctuality. After some argument with the ground staff at the gate, I managed to get onto the flight with the supervisor granting me an act of grace, when it’s Emirates which had sinned. But his grace did not extend to my checked in baggage however, which will only arrive with the next flight. Arrangement to make delivery of my delayed baggage was made immediately after clearing immigration on arrival in Rome FCO airport Friday at 6.40pm, when I was assured my luggage would arrive following day. I even received an email saying my bag will arrive in Rome at about 12.40pm on Saturday. Little did I know I would be slapped in my face with Emirates’ commitment to punctuality again. When I haven’t received my bag at 5pm, I rang the baggage office, and was advised it had just cleared customs and would be delivered in the evening. 6 hours later I was still waiting, and followed up with another less than pleasant phone call. Upon which, the only solution they could offer is the contact number of the local baggage delivery agent. No, of course their gilded fingers can’t possibly dial the number to follow up on a customer’s delayed baggage. I finally received my bag on Sunday at 12.15am. Hooray for a change of clothes finally.

"✅ Verified Review |  Melbourne to Auckland. This was my second trip on this route with the same airline, and the biggest difference was the service from the Cabin Crew. The morning started with a visit to the Emirates Lounge, an excellent decision. Boarding once again was chaotic, no specific lines indicating Economy, Business or First. No one knew where to go and the Ground Team just did nothing to put order in place. When we were airborne, the onboard service started and I immediately felt the FA's were not as personal compared to my previous experience. The all seem too busy with getting the job done, rather than taking the time to engage with passengers. Food and beverages were average, though the portions can definitely increase in size. The seat was comfortable and, with blankets and pillows distributed to all passengers. On a good note, the IFE was fantastic as the amount of content can keep you entertain for hours.

"✅ Verified Review |  This was our first flight using Emirates from Glasgow to Sydney via Dubai and it will be our last. We were looking forward to flying Emirates as it had the reputation of being a luxury airline with adverts showing courteous attendants there to serve their customers with a smile. The reality was quite the opposite. The flight attendants were sullen and rude with very poor customer service. The staff at the boarding gate were quite cheery, laughing and smiling amongst themselves until it was time for the passengers to board. We met with dour stony faces - no smile, genuine welcome or attempt at being polite. We felt more like an inconvenience. Once on board we were in the air for 2 hours before any drinks were offered. Again no pleasantries just quite abrupt service. The meal was ok but breakfast after a 7 hour flight was a 2 finger shortbread biscuit. The return leg was no better, in fact worse. We experienced the same sullen attitude from the staff with the addition of an air of superiority as they marched up and down the aisle, and woe betide anyone in their way. If we happened to be standing in the aisle they would barge passed, no excuse me or waiting for you to get something out your bag. Meal service was again slow and very sloppy. The attendant spilled hot fat from the breakfast dish over my white trousers. She did get some cloths but the stains haven’t come out. The other attendant passed a hot meal over my head to my husband - are they not taught how to serve customers? We were given blankets but these were collected long before the end of the flight. The final “thank you for flying Emirates” sounded matter of fact and so insincere. On the return we missed our connection from Brisbane to Dubai due to bad weather and were put on the next flight which was 8 hours later at 5am. We were given food vouchers but they turned out to be useless as all the shops were shut. Apart from a couple of cleaners the airport was empty. When we explained to the staff when the desk opened they showed no interest and no sign of concern for their customers’ comfort. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with, even the cheap budget airlines have a more respectful attitude towards their customers.

"✅ Verified Review |  Barcelona to Melbourne via Dubai.  We were looking forward to flying with Emirates - we hadn't flown with them before and had heard good things. But unfortunately the customer service (or lack thereof) from the Flight Attendants onboard both flights was atrocious. I have written over a month ago to the Emirates Feedback form on their website but have not had any response - perhaps they are overwhelmed with complaints? For a start, none of the staff seemed to be smiling or happy. I didn't really think anything of it at first until I realised how uncomfortable I felt with the sour faces around me. About an hour into the flight I thought I would use the restroom. I was on the left side of the plane in an aisle seat, row 56. I had seen other passengers walking up and down the aisle using the restrooms and so I walked forward too, where I could see the toilet sign. A male flight attendant asked me where I was going? I said, ""To the toilet. I'm going to the restroom."" He shouted, ""Back! Get back. Go back!"" and flung his arm towards the back of the plane. I was shocked at his attitude and aggression that I returned to my seat. He came over to me and said, ""You can use the toilet at the back of the plane."" I explained that I had seen other people moving freely around the plane and that I felt he had spoken to me incredibly rudely. He said I could use the toilet towards the front if I wanted. I have no idea how many international and domestic flights I have been on in my 48 years, but I have never been spoken to like that - with so little provocation!  The other flight attendants were equally rude; no communication or attempt at being polite or friendly. An hour and a half before we landed in Dubai they literally pulled blankets off people and demanded headsets and were more concerned with shoving all the blankets into the toilet cubicles than with the passengers waiting to use the restrooms. Many of the passengers in Dubai were talking about how rude the flight attendants had been and why they had to take blankets and headsets from people so early? Unfortunately they were not much better from Dubai to Melbourne. Again, no smiles, no warmth - they would say ""Drink?"" with raised eyebrows (no smile) and when I would say, ""An orange juice please,"" they would place it onto a tray and just shove the tray into my face without a word. Literally into my face. I am writing because I had heard good things about Emirates - but the flight attendants have really let the company down.

"✅ Verified Review | The positives for Emirates is to do with the aircraft, as the A380 offers comfortable seats with adequate legroom. The list of negatives is quite big: - Crew members didn't bother to assist during embarkation resulting a really slow process. Even worse, when most passengers had to look for available cabinets to store their luggage nobody from the crew members even bothered to pretend to be interested and assist. Passengers who wanted their dinner to be accompanied with wine or beverage had to wait more than 20 minutes to be served. Long, literally long, queues at lavatories. Crew didn't assist at all. I do understand that when the not to be disturbed sticker has fallen from the seat, crew will try to wake you up in order to serve breakfast. Still that should not reach the stage where they will literally poke you and scream close to your ears. They could either open the folded tray and leave it there or let you a note that they didn't serve because you were sleeping. Having two options for dinner (when you promote yourself as top carrier) is quite limited. Saying that you have two options for dinner when the number of available portions of one is small compared to the overall number of passengers (particular flight was almost fully booked) is laughable. Some people do not eat chicken (sounds strange but I do not eat it), I can understand that due to any reasons you are out of beef (actually I do not understand it but anyway) but that does not mean that you have to force me to get your chicken dish and refuse (actually they did not refuse, just didn't bother to reply and moved on) to take it back.

"✅ Verified Review |  New York JFK to Milan. As 400 passengers deplaned in Milan there were only two customs agents available for non European Union passengers. Poor planning to say the least. It took well over an hour to clear customs. By the time I tried to obtain my luggage it was missing. There was no one to check and see if the baggage removed belonged to the owner. What is the use of giving a baggage claim if it is ignored. Thus It is very easy to steal luggage from the airport in Milan.

Emirates would not deliver it to my hotel and I had to go to the trouble and expense of traveling to the Venice airport to pick up my luggage. The second day of my vacation wasted. After obtaining my bag I was informed by Emirates that it would take at least 4 weeks to respond to my complaint. I’m sure that they just wanted me to have finished my travels to respond so that they would not have to upgrade my return travel. After 6 weeks I received a form letter that hid behind the Montreal protocol to tell me that they would pay for the clothes that I had purchased. No addressing of any issues or answer to any of my questions.

"✅ Verified Review |  Perth to Manchester via Dubai, returning from Paris. We have traveled with Emirates Business Class many times in the past and although not perfect, we have never had cause for complaint until now. We traveled to Manchester from Perth on 4th September 2017. Our flight to Manchester was uneventful. However, the walk (including train) to our connecting flight (EK19) was horrendous. It took at least 30 minutes to get from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1. Considering there is no significant layover time between flights, if the incoming flight from Perth had been delayed, we would have missed the Manchester flight. Another passenger who was also on the same flights looked quite ill from the strenuous walk. Many UK ex-pats live in Perth and would have been connecting to the Manchester flight, why was this flight from Terminal 1 and not terminal 3? The experience on our return flight flights was even worse. The service and food on the flight from Paris to Dubai from 30th September 2017 (EK76) was unacceptable. Food was cold (soup) and a steak that I ordered was uneatable. I asked for a glass of wine with my dinner and this did not materialise until 30 minutes after I had finished my meal. Seats were also very uncomfortable. Once again a walk and train for our flight to Perth (EK424). When the flight was eventually called we were subjected to being herded on a bus for a 10 minute drive to the plane and then had to climb a staircase to board. I have had a better embarkation experience with AirAsia and this is totally unacceptable for an airline of Emirates reputation. The flight arrived in Perth over an hour late, obviously due to the embarkation process. With the exception of the return flight from Dubai to Perth (EK424) food on all other sectors was mediocre at best and unacceptable at worst. The business class lounge in Dubai was as useful packed to the rafters and quite uncomfortable. The highlight of the flight was the food and service in the Emirates Paris Business Lounge. It is a shame that Emirates cannot maintain this consistency of service and cuisine across all flight services. We travel Business Class to Europe at least once every year and more often than not with Emirates.

My flight landed in time at JFK airport but due to some traffic problem we were forced to stay onboard for almost an hour. By that time my connecting JetBlue flight was missed. I am a wheelchair candidate and airport guys just dumped me at an empty JetBlue gate. I was trying to get in contact with Emirates office, not able get on phone at that time. So I called JetBlue and was forced to book 2 only available tickets for next day. As I was waiting , I tried again Emirates office and they agreed to book the the same ticket which I booked for. But I had to cancel the ticket which I booked myself, cost me $100. It was so awful that I had to stay at airport 15 hrs more sitting on a single chair, after 14hrs flight.

No particular issues - both journeys (16.5h eastbound / 17h westbound) went quite well. But this was only because we were flying the sector in an A380; I would not recommend a flight of this length in a 10-seat-across B777 (or a 9-seat-across B787), because these aircraft would be too cramped. The A380 is still as excellent an aircraft to fly in as ever. On the return service, the flight itself had very few passengers (<100), so the service was excellent. As for the GLA-DXB sector, the Boeing 777 is tolerable, but only just (both flights were pretty full). I like flying Emirates.

"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Dubai to Toronto with Emirates. Staff very nice and accommodating. Seats are OK, no more. They do not offer leg support, you can stretch to have your feet on foot rest but no leg support. They offer thin mattresses which is a good thing because the seats are quite hard. Seat belts are a bit short and offer very limited extension capabilities. Entertainment system is awesome and so is the ""OnAir"" Internet. Good meals. It would be nice if coffee and tea could be offered at the same time they bring the meals. Not sure that the space reserved for the bar/entertainment area is really the best use of that space.

"✅ Verified Review | The one area that consistently disappoints with Emirates is their service. I have consistently experienced poor service flying Business class with them. I've often found their economy class staff service to be much better surprisingly. I just cannot understand how an airlines that is so highly rated cannot get their service right especially in Business class. Approached the Business Class check-in person in Dubai with my wife and child and we were greeted by a grumpy lady gesturing to place our passports on the desk. No smiles, no conversation nothing, did her work, handed out our boarding passes and motioned us to the direction of the gate. Not a word was spoken. I was expecting to board directly from one of the gates at the business class lounge as generally is the case with A380 flights but we were motioned to go down to the gate and board from the gate with everyone. At the gate there was no separate boarding for business / first class, waited in the long line with everyone. Once we got into the flight, we settled down onto the amazing business class seats and was looking forward to a comfortable flight. Just then a flight attendant bumped into another attendant who was serving champagne to a customer and the whole contents of the tray spilled over on to me. I was soaked in champagne before the 14 hour journey to Toronto had even started. A quick word of apology was muttered and I was handed a towel to clean up and was directed to the washroom where some more towels were handed out while my seat was being cleaned. I returned back to my seat to find that champagne was still pouring out of the creases and cracks of my seat. I asked for one more towel and never got it. Later during the flight I asked for a headphone for my child and the response I got was ""One was placed on every seat"". That's it. I had to get one myself from another unoccupied seat. Every time the same lady came to clear my table / seat of any clutter or finished meal, I was motioned to place them on her tray. It was like she couldn't be bothered to reach out and pick them up. So I spent the flight collecting things around my seat to place it on her tray every time she came. The whole experience was really shocking especially after the fortune you had coughed up for the experience. Emirates boasts of taking extra effort to take care of children, my 3 year old's presence was not once acknowledged, the only gesture was a child's goodie bag being handed out. We also experienced similarly disappointing service at the Emirates check-in counter at Toronto airport on our way back to Dubai. No smile, no word. I asked if the flight was full to which I got the reply ""Wait I am trying to read something here"". Never ended up getting an answer. The service on the flight (Economy class this time) was however excellent. I commended them on their efforts. Makes me wonder though why the such a difference in service between the two classes? If at all one should experience better service for business class yea? I have encountered similar experiences in previous flights with them as well - generally rude and snobbish flight attendants in business class while the opposite is true for economy class.",5,2017-10-11,United Arab Emirates,False,review one area consistently disappoints emirate service consistently experienced poor service flying business class often found economy class staff service much better surprisingly cannot understand airline highly rated cannot get service right especially business class approached business class check person dubai wife child greeted grumpy lady gesturing place passport desk smile conversation nothing work handed boarding pass motioned u direction gate word spoken expecting board directly one gate business class lounge generally case flight motioned go gate board gate everyone gate separate boarding business first class waited long line everyone got flight settled onto amazing business class seat looking forward comfortable flight flight attendant bumped another attendant serving champagne customer whole content tray spilled soaked champagne hour journey toronto even started quick word apology muttered handed towel clean directed washroom towel handed seat cleaned returned back seat find champagne still pouring crease crack seat asked one towel never got later flight asked headphone child response got one placed every seat get one another unoccupied seat every time lady came clear table seat clutter finished meal motioned place tray like bothered reach pick spent flight collecting thing around seat place tray every time came whole experience really shocking especially fortune coughed experience emirate boast taking extra effort take care child year old presence acknowledged gesture child goodie bag handed also experienced similarly disappointing service emirate check counter toronto airport way back dubai smile word asked flight full got reply wait trying read something never ended getting answer service flight economy class time however excellent commended effort make wonder though difference service two class one experience better service business class yea encountered similar experience previous flight well generally rude snobbish flight attendant business class opposite true economy class
✅ Verified Review |  Melbourne to Cape Town via Dubai. My wife and I were unable to select a seat on our flight from MEL-DXB-CPT until about 48 hour before the flight unless we pay $30 for each sector. We decided against and selected seats 48 hours before the flight. The real problem arose on our return journey from HDS-JNB-DXB-MEL. The HDS-JNB flight was with South African Airline and yet I was unable to checkin the Emirate flight from JNB-DXB-MEL. Emirates website directed us to check in via South African Airlines although the bookings confirmation numbers are different. I did online check in with South African Airline website but they insisted that I can only checkin the Emirate flights with Emirates website. Anyway we arrived in Johannesburg JNB and went to the Emirates check in desk. I explain to the check in person that we require an aisle and the next seat so that we do not have to disturb the next passenger for toilet break. After all explanation she gave us a window and middle seat. She disregarded our request. To top it up she directed our bags to MEL but will not and could give us the boarding pass from DXB to MEL. She stated that there is a regulation and restriction to do so. Surprisingly two other Australians who were checking in in the next counter were giving boarding passes with seat allocation all the way to Melbourne. When we landed in Dubai I went to Emirates service and requested boarding passes and the appropriate seats. To our surprise we were given two seats (under the same booking number). Mine was in row 66 and my wife in row 88. We were totally separated. We were told that the flight was over booked. No amount request and pleading was considered. We were told to go the the boarding gate and ask for different seats but there is no guarantee that we will be together. The Emirates staff were rude and acted like robots. Finally at the boarding gate we were given a window and middle seats. We had to constantly disturb the person sitting in aisle seat for toilet visits.

"✅ Verified Review | Melbourne to Auckland. What an amazing experience, words cannot describe how great the service was onboard. From Check In, passport control and customs, everything was fast and efficient. Before departure, I decided to the visit the Qantas First Class Lounge instead of the Emirates Lounge. The plane was delayed up to an hour because of a late arrival of the aircraft from Dubai alongside with the most disorganised boarding process, other than those mishaps everything else was fantastic. Once on board I was greeted by a very lovely and attentive Flight attendant, who walked me to my First Class Suite 2A. Drinks, Arabic coffee and dates were offered right after. As I was the only First Class passenger, the attention I received was beyond what was needed which I deeply appreciated. Breakfast was served right after takeoff, everything tasted delicious and there was endless snacks and drinks on offer even when you don't even ask for it.

No structure of meals was announced so was waiting for food which never came. Video screens were small and I was the lucky one who had the entertainment box at their feet - very uncomfortable.

Also, the beef option for the dinner meal had far too much salt in it, could not eat it. If you're not an Emirates frequent flyer it seems they do little to try to get you to become one.

"✅ Verified Review |  San Francisco to Chenna via Dubai. I had bad experience with the air-host. I was given a meal that I don't eat. Upon requested to change the meal to the one I selected at the time of booking (veggie), the answer provided was that I did not select the meal. Fact is that I did select the meal as soon as I booked my ticket. In fact, later I called up the airline because I was unable to select Infant meal for all the flights and confirmed that my meal is selected.  I spoke to the air-host and he replied with a question if I selected the meal. He said he'll check the file and get back. He did not. When questioned, he said he does not have any vegetarian meal. I asked for a fruit. That was my meal for lunch. For breakfast, the air-host asked ""What would you like to have (was given 2 choices)"". I said  the one I selected. He replied that he does not have. I thought they don't have the kind of breakfast I was seeking. I walked up to another hostess without the knowledge of this person and she gave me the veggie breakfast.  I was terribly upset, tired with baby on my lap the whole time and hungry. I confronted with him on the flight questioning his conscience of how indifferent he could be. I asked who I should contact for this.

"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to London via Dubai for the 2nd time in the last 18 months. I feel that on several levels, the Emirates product has declined in quality. Being 2m tall, I normally never have issues with being allocated an exit row seat so that I can sit without my legs being restricted by the seat in front of me. 2 weeks prior to flying I had called the Emirates Call Center and spoke to a very helpful gentleman who informed me that exit seats are only allocated on arrival at the airport. Fair enough, I got to BKK early and was allocated an exit Row seat on the flight to Dubai. I was told that I would then need to be allocated an exit Row seat in Dubai. Upon arrival at Dubai which was 3 hours before the flight departed, I was told that all seats had been allocated. Nothing could be done. Thats it. Surely saving exit row seats for people who actually require them is a better way of operating? Other issues. Toilets were filthy, and were not cleaned during the flight. The cabin crew were rarely seen, and seemed quiet content to serve a passenger excess alcohol who was later abusive to passengers. Again, cabin crew were not concerned to sort or prevent this issue.

"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to Hong Kong. As a regular in business class on Emirates A380 on this route for 7 years, I was not prepared for what awaited me at the bag drop on Sunday. The supervisor approached me and very pleasantly asked if I would consider being downgraded to economy as the flight was overbooked in all classes. Ready to stand my ground, she made it clear that would be fully understandable. Then she explained that in return for downgrading, the airline would offer the usual business facilities - priority security pass and use of the lounge - plus an unrestricted free round trip business class ticket on the same route valid for a year. Or she could offer me a business class seat on a Thai Airways flight leaving around the same time. Having read horror stories of downgrading and long delays in getting refunds from other airlines, this transaction was conducted without any pressure and with my full understanding that the decision was mine. I took the downgrade and proceeded to the lounge for an excellent lunch. At the gate, the same supervisor took me out of the queue, handed me the voucher for the free return ticket and invited me to board first. This was exemplary service of the highest order. The flight itself was equally fine. I had a comfortable window seat in the first row of the lower deck. Service was efficient and with a smile. I did not take the full meal but the starter and dessert were very tasty.

Their seats and entertainment are good and comfortable. But we are not impressed by the service of the staff. When I asked for hot tea, the staff would say ""you can ask my colleague later"", which you have to wait till you see a staff passing by. The next staff would say the same thing to me too. We had problem checking in the return flight. But there was an error saying that check in is not possible for this flight. We immediately called Emirates but the staff said online check in is not allowed at Heathrow airport, and said we have to check in when we reach the airport the next day.  When we reached the airport, we were told that our return flight was canceled. We were not informed in advance. The staff ushered us to join a long queue which we stood queueing for almost two hours! When we asked what happen, can we get another flight back to Singapore? The staff said ""You will get to choose an earlier or later flight, or put up at a hotel. please talk to the next staff"". The staff didn't even apologise. When we reached the counter, staff asked for our passport, focused on the computer and passed us our boarding pass for tomorrow noon. We didn't even get to choose!

We asked to get an earlier flight, but again the staff said ""please talk to our staff when you reach Dubai"". She also asked us to reach the airport 4 hours before boarding tomorrow. We tried to enjoy our flight to Dubai and when we reached, we asked the staff to help us get an earlier to singapore.

"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Newcastle to Trivandrum via Dubai. Emirates is one of the few remaining airlines that offers a differential in Economy class. I love other airlines in Premium, Business or First but so few airlines now stand out with their Economy product. Emirates offers a fabulous economy product, the seat is comfortable, there is sufficient leg room for me at 6 foot 2. The food is good, I like being provided with a menu prior to service, a nice touch. Entertainment is the best in the sky in my experience. A free 20mb of internet browsing is extremely handy if you need to connect and do not want to spend lots of money as is the case with the relatively few airlines that offer any internet service at all. If you want more internet the prices are reasonable. Emirates crews are always in my experience excellent. My only (personal) regret about Emirates is they do not have a competitive price to fly between the UK and Brazil. Its a very long way of getting to Brazil from UK (I do this route frequently).

"✅ Verified Review | The basics are good and we had a good experience with Emirates from Bangkok to Düsseldorf via Dubai. Especially the newest A380's are very comfortable because the better seats and bigger IFE screens. On our outbound journy we had upper deck seats which are very nice and I do recommend to try to get a seat up there. The older A380's were a bit less comfortable and nice. The difference between the new and old(er) cabin is big, that's a shame. Food is good, sometimes we had to ask for a drink because the cabin crew wasn't walking around that frequently. The food, seat comfort and IFE was good. We experienced some things that annoyed us a little bit. The most important is the delays due to chaotic boarding processes. There was not enough dicipline to succeed the zone boarding system. Plus, the bad communication between staff and customers. Customer service told us it was no problem to link our luggage to Dubai only, and not to Düsseldorf as we planned a long layover to see Dubai. At Bangkok, the check-in agent told us if we wanted to have our luggage checked to Dubai, we had to pay an additional fee of 6800 baht each. Overall: I would recommend flying with Emirates because the comfort.

"✅ Verified Review |  Good bye Emirates. In January I booked flights with Emirates for my wife and me, Bangkok to Rome via Dubai, returning Munich to Bangkok via Dubai. Due to endless amendments by Emirates our trip turned out to be the worst ever. One month before departure I was informed that flight time from Bangkok to Dubai has been changed. Usually not a big deal, but I would appreciate to be asked instead of putting us on a different flight. On the flight Munich – Dubai one of the flight attendant refused to offer soft drinks except orange juice and water, referring that drinks like Fanta or Coke have to be purchased at the bar. (what bar? as we were flying economy). Waiting for flight Dubai to Bangkok at the boarding area, about 15 minutes before boarding we were informed that it was changed to a different gate and new ETD will be 13:45. Right afterwards their ground staff left without further comment. We found the new gate deserted, leaving passengers for more than 2 hours alone with questions regarding connecting fights, meals or drinks. After having breakfast on the Munich to Dubai flight at around 4am, I expected at least a snack and a drink to bridge the waiting time of 2½ hours. About 20 minutes before boarding the ground staff appeared and informed that the departure will be delayed by another 10 minutes. 10 minutes later we were informed that boarding will delayed by another 10 minutes. At this stage a considerable number of passengers lost their patience and protested loudly. Finally boarding stated at 14:05 instead of 11:45, arriving at Bangkok at 23:45 instead of 21:25. Leaving us for uninformed, hungry and thirsty stranded at Dubai airport for more than 2 hours is unacceptable and contradicting with Emirates claim to be the Best Airline in the World. Under European legislation we would be eligible to a significant refund, but unfortunately we needed to book our flights in Bangkok. With the recent reduction of economy luggage allowance from 30 to 20 kgs (unless you are willing to pay extra $ for a “saver” ticket) and the implementation of a reservation fee of 25USD per person, Emirates is getting closer to traditional low cost carriers, while asking for premium rates.

"✅ Verified Review |  Bahrain to Nairobi via Dubai. The Emirates policy of applying excess baggage charges for items purchased in duty free on the DXB to NBO sector is arbitary. I have flown Emirates on a number of occasions and have never seen a weight scale at a departure gate in DXB. Each economy passenger was directed ""as per airline policy"" to weigh all cabin bags, including those containing duty free items. The response from Emirates ground staff for extra items bought in duty free was either pay the excess or return the items for a refund from the outlet. I understand the weight limits for cabin baggage from a safety perspective. However, I have not seen any objections from an ground staff when a passenger has purchased a number of duty free items in departures. Returning on the NBO to DXB sector no similar policy applied, same for the DXB to BAH leg. Emirates need to treat all passengers as people.  Staff at the gate ignored my request to have the extra cabin bag, (bought in DXB duty free) loaded into the hold, one option used by some airlines. Overall, if you strip away the slick advertising of the brand summed up as ""we are the best, (in our view) what you are left with is an economy service that includes food, IFE and cabin crew.

Sure, you might say they didn't want to wake me up, but they didn't even take the courtesy to put the immigration card in my seat pocket! Because of that, I had to go to Adelaide and get one at the airport security there to fill, when others just went past me. Alas, I was not the only one, they left out another 4-5 people without immigration cards too. The only thing good about Emirates is their infight meals.

"✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Bangalore via Dubai. Until now I have always enjoyed flying Emirates. Real quality however proves itself when things go wrong. And then Emirates customer service is very low quality. On our flight to Bangalore we got delayed by more than 10 hours. First airplane was hit by lightning and had to be checked, replacement took long and when a new plane was ready and we had boarded it turned out that Bangalore airport was closed during the day due to construction works (Emirates knew this before), we had to offboard again in Dubai and wait for more than 8 hours. Except for some not too fresh rolls no help or service was provided. Customer service refused any help, for instance helping to find a hotel, a place to sleep or proper compensation. We were sent from one side of Dubai airport to another all the time. An online complaint only gets a marketing answer but no real solutions or compensation was provided. On the way back from Bangalore I had pre-booked a dietary request: Asian vegetarian. It turned out Asian vegetarian was a standard choice on this flight. By the time the trolly reached me all vegetarian meals were gone. As a vegetarian I only could chose chicken. The steward said they forgot about me and again I only could get a not too fresh roll. Again an online complaint, some vague excuses as an answer but no real compensation. So to conclude, in general Emirates is excellent, but when problems arise the services they provide are like a low cost airliner.

There was Sterfan instead of Stefan (so letter r too much). I called Emirates to ask if this was a problem. This had to be changed, because at the airport this would cause problems and could not be changed. Cost was 47 EUR. Really absurd.

Boeing 777 aircraft in 2-3-2 configuration in Business class is clearly not matching the high expectations you have if flying with this airline. The seat on this leg was old style not fully lie flat which made this morning flight quite unpleasant. Also remarkable for me that Emirates provided only on the night flight from Dubai to Shanghai an amenity kit. The content even being from a high rated known cosmetic company is not special at all lacking ear plugs. Seen much better Kits eg. Turkish Airlines or even at Tap Portugal. In general the A380 cabin and seat better but inconsistent. Seats and plugs different on all 3 flights in A380. Seat lie flat but felt unconfortable to me as uneven. Also negatively surprised by the service level provided by the crew which was from hectic to chaotic. As noticed from others fellows in this Forum seems to be a hit or miss. Though always announced from the Cockpit ""as award winning cabin crew"" I was unfortunate and got too often the miss. Only exception was the crew on the B777 leg contrasting to the aircraft.

"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Lisbon, EK191 on 17th April. Was this the same airline as we flew out on? The check in staff were able to book our luggage through to our final destination (Faro) but not us! This created a bit of a problem for the TAP staff at Lisbon. On boarding the cabin crew were chatting among themselves in the galley areas and there was no-one to welcome us to our normal (47K) seat in the rear cabin. There was a noticeable tension and seemed to be a lack of teamship amongst the crew with false smiles rather than the genuine ones of the outbound crew. Continental breakfast was served but the coffee/tea forgotten - our call bell ignored and when my wife went to ask for coffees she was told ""okay but it will be cold"". After this they disappeared into the galley areas for 5 hours, occasionally rushing through the cabin but ignoring our call bell when we fancied a drink before lunch which was then served 1.5 hours before landing meaning that it was rushed - coffee and wine were being offered at the same time and they wanted to clear trays before we had even finished the main course (which to add to our dismay was tough, grisly beef).

"✅ Verified Review | Delhi to Amsterdam via Dubai. You know what to expect when you are flying with Emirates. The 777s are inconsistent in their economy class seats - some have USB ports and other have older seats. The food (AVML) is always superior and especially flying out of Dubai - actually the best plane food is served on Emirates. Seat comfort on 777 is sub-par in comparison to the economy seating in A380 which is the most comfortable I have been on in terms of leg space, seat width, recline and fittings. The quietest cabin on the lower deck on the A380 is the one at the back and yes, it does give a premium economy experience being exclusive with fewer seat rows. WiFi on board is inexpensive but can be spotty depending on the routes. IFE, of course, remains, fabulous. Cabin crew are mostly friendly - some are heartwarming and very helpful, while others forget their smile at home. All aircraft were very clean, have great in flight lightning including StarLight on the cabin ceiling (which I love) and well stocked, clean washrooms. The business class lounge in Dubai is sometimes very busy and the Concourse B one has the coveted Moet and Chandon bar which is a must visit if you have status.

I could have flown direct to Dubai to transfer for Cairo, but I cut the journey in half by changing planes in Bangkok (saved more than USD2000), although that's 6 sectors of flying in total, but all in first class, and I saved a great deal. 4 sectors were in the spacious A380 with luxurious shower bathroom, the other 2 in B777, all suites. I was served with excellent cuisine, drinks and the service was so attentive without being too intrusive. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept on in the sky, and the shower incredible.

Standards were high and the crews encountered displayed a high level of motivation. We still have the Boeing 777 as the only option from Dublin but they were all in superb condition. Plenty of complementary goodies for the ladies and as much food and drink you fancied at the click of the galley button. The Dubai stopovers were well organised and a really good room at Le Meridien was provided, along with copious food and beverage vouchers.

"✅ Verified Review |  Starting with the best part: one of the reasons we selected Emirates is that they fly the A380 on all legs of our journey from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Dubai. The whole upper deck of Emirates A380 is Business class. The seats are configured 1-2-1. You can make a 180 degrees bed from it, there's a huge screen, a separate tablet (no idea why) and a mini bar with some drinks on it. Lots of space for everything. In the back there's a bar with lots of delicious small things to eat and a good reason to leave your chair from time to time, even if you do not normally visit bars. The A380 is super silent. We flew Business Class on a Qatar 787 earlier and the noise level of the 787 is so much higher than that of the Airbus. The A380 is the best plane we have flown, unbelievable that they have struggled for orders. Emirates has more: free limousine service up to 65 km, in comfortable cars and all well arranged. Lounges in Dubai and Bangkok offer great food and other facilities like a shower, the Schiphol lounge in contrast has just a few things to eat. But Emirates has drawbacks too. Vegetarian meals in business class are very poor. One of our meals mainly consisted of two salads of the type ""what are the cheapest ingredients we can find"". Why not serve what they serve in their lounges? The best Business Class meals so far were from KLM. No A380's but well thought about vegetarian meals. Also we phoned if they could combine vegetarian and gluten free. That could be arranged but it wasn't. They can't. On a business class ticket with a list price of multiple 1000's euros. And it really is not so difficult. Qatar could do it. Qatar also serves the meal when you want - Emirates serves the meal shortly after you enjoyed the Dubai lounge buffet. Two more drawbacks: when we complained the reply was something like ""Sorry you didn't like it but Emirates serves the best food in the airline industry"". So they can't serve nice vegetarian meals and on top of that they don't take complaints seriously. What I also disliked is that the entertainment system (which in itself is the best we have ever seen, title wise) displays news messages on all selection screens. Why would I want that? I am on holiday and don't want to read news.

"✅ Verified Review |  My recent flight from Taipei to London via Dubai was thoroughly enjoyable, both night and daylight flights. Taipei to Dubai sector was full yet the crew managed to address passengers by name and were attentive. I love the onboard bar and despite full capacity, was rather empty, with most snuggled up to sleep. It was a 4 hour connection to London at Dubai. Even though the Dubai lounge with its facilities for relaxing, sleeping or dining, I had to wait 45 minutes for a shower to be available. However, I was refreshed for my flight back to London, the service was impeccable. Even after a Venison main course and cheese board lunch, the crew were inviting me to the bar for more snacks. I have noticed that the A380s on the Taipei-Dubai, Hong Kong-Dubai and Singapore-Dubai flights are newer seating than the London-Dubai A380s. My one small beef about Emirates Business Class is the seat itself. It must be narrowest - just an inch wider than the Economy I think. I am small, but I find it still too narrow compared to other airline seats which are 20-22 inches wide. One passenger I spoke to said he could not get any sleep and felt claustrophobic. I guess seat width has been sacrificed to include the clutter of the Mini Bar and Tablet (I've never seen anyone use the Tablet).

"✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Delhi via Dubai. We have flown Emirates several times to visit family in India. However, in December 2016, an issue arose with our plane during take off. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. They kept us on the plane at the gate for 3 hours. They fed us dinner and right after we were told to exit the plane. We knew we wouldn't be taking off that night, so having us sit in the gate area would've allowed for more comfort and food options. After those 3 hours, we stood in a line for 3 hours to get a hotel voucher since the next flight we could be on was not until Friday morning (it was 1am Wed Night at this point) and did not live close to the airport. We obtained the hotel voucher and headed to our hotel, only to be returned because the hotel was full and said the airline didn't call them to approve the availability. Needless to say, we didn't get to a hotel until 5am. We were put in a hotel 12 miles away and were told we could get refunded for the Uber, but it's been 2 months since the receipt was submitted and still have not received the $58 back. Flight Friday was delayed again by about 5 hours, so we missed our connection and had to stay in Dubai a night since there were no open flights. So we missed 4 days of our trip. The cabin is nice, clean and updated. The food is usually pretty good for airplane food! There is good pitch between seats and good seat width. On our trip back though, our seat cushions were pretty poor in quality and rather uncomfortable/hard to sit on. I would fly again, but seeing how they recently changed their ""saver"" rates to where you cannot choose your seat until check-in, we are looking for another airline.

"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Melbourne. Before boarding I was paged to see the ground staff which I did and was asked by a rude staff if I could change my exit row seat for another passenger wishing to seat as a couple. I said no. Then during the messy boarding process I was refused boarding and directed to go back to the counter to see another ground staff, I was made to wait and treated as if I had done something wrong. The staff later took my boarding pass with an annoyed look clicked on her computer and handed back to me without a word. No explanation, no apology nothing such rudeness in the way they treat passengers. On boarding the aircraft witness an angry passenger who wanted my seat apparently and made a fuss to the cabin crew and chief Steward. She was a lone passenger so it appears that the ground crew lied about a couple wanting to sit together. Why should I be inconvenienced at the expense of others - am I not a passenger worthy of some dignity and respect? The service on this flight was at best sloppy and the crew seemed unpolished. Some were though to be fair so forgivable. But after the main course served the crew disappeared until time for a small second meal prior to landing which was a cold muffin and cold roll for breakfast - really bad! No orange juice, the crew just said don't have and that was it. No water runs between meals.

"✅ Verified Review |  Manchester to Phuket via Dubai. Manchester check in and lounge very good. Boarded A380 seats 11E/F, not as originally booked as aircraft changed to an A380 from Boeing 777. Personally I find the A380 very claustrophobic and the seat most uncomfortable; there is limited room for elbows especially with the ICE tablet and seat divider screen getting in the way. No matter how much I tried, I could not get comfortable in the seat. Cabin crew were friendly on boarding but during the flight they seemed very elusive. A walk to the bar area on several occasions found that passengers in the bar outnumbered by cabin crew. Meals on this leg of the journey were less than memorable and service was poor; I am still waiting for the cheeseboard to be served even though I reminded cabin crew three times that I had not received it. And where is the chocolate that is mentioned on the menus but is noticeable by its absence? And there was no amenity kit provided, is this a cost cutting measure? On the Dubai to Phuket leg, the seats were much more comfortable for me than on the A380. The Boeing 777 was reasonably smart but was beginning to show signs of wear and tear, Cabin crew on this flight were OK but service was still below what it should be.

One can barely hear the noise from the engine and the flight is so smooth. We did not feel that the aircraft has taken off and landed already. The cabin crews are very attentive to the needs of the passengers. Aircraft is new and well-maintained. This is the second time I flew Emirates using A380 and I will definitely fly with them again.",5,2017-02-23,Philippines,False,review hong kong bangkok flying emirate short haul appears cheaper low cost airline asia emirate provides full service generous luggage allowance kg economy class food great one choose vegetarian low sodium diet cabin spacious one barely hear noise engine flight smooth feel aircraft taken landed already cabin crew attentive need passenger aircraft new well maintained second time flew emirate using definitely fly
"✅ Verified Review |  I have been taking Emirates service between Bangkok and Hong Kong a few times a year for more than 6 years. Little has changed (although on the more recent A380s there is unfortunately no side pocket for books, iPads etc.), the meals and wines remain very good, the bar at the back is excellent, service is efficient and the lounge offerings better than most airlines. Plus I love the aircraft. But I have to bring up two issues. The IFE Guide used to be user-friendly. Now the airline has jazzed it up, it is a design mess and extremely difficult to read! Movies have no timings. What is the point of that, especially for short flights? To find out timings you have to open each channel and wade through ads each time. So if you are considering which of 4 or 5 movies to select you waste a lot of time and patience with the added possibility you'll miss the end of the movie before landing. Then there are the audio programmes. Once again the classical music section used to be hugely comprehensive. Now it is another mess. What is the point of having a composer's name as the title of a channel - like just Mendelssohn or Mozart - when the works being performed are not listed? Do we have to check the screen every time? If so, then even that often does not provide the information. Wagner wrote operas and so is understandably included in the Opera section (although with no works listed). Yet he also appears in the non-operatic section. To find out what that included, I started the channel. Nothing on the screen gave me any clue what was about to be played. Never mentioned anywhere is the fact it is the opera Das Rheingold - almost two and a half hours non-stop music and singing! No indication either of artists, conductors and orchestras, all of interest to those listening. Something really has to be done to include more pertinent accurate detail in the Guide. My other disappointment was having foregone the meal and watched a movie, when it was over I went to the bar to get some canapés. As I went to the nearby toilet to wash my hands, there were plenty available. Less than 45 seconds later, everything had been dumped into the trash bins - even though there were still 35 minutes of the flight remaining and drinks were still being served.

"✅ Verified Review |  Hong Kong to Dubai. They blocked seats so when I tried to check in online 48hr before, I was stuck in the seat they assigned me. We were a family of four travelling together. We were separated in the huge A380. I cannot move our family to sit together or even close by. I called the customer service, and also raised my concern with their social media team, the feedback I got was that all passengers had already checked in by then - which was ridiculous. And they refused to help. Their staff told me, in a quite rude way, that I should've paid a lot more for a better cabin. Second, on the flight from Dubai to Hong Kong, they ran out of food (food, not food selection) when the trolly reached me. I asked why this happened since there was fixed number of passengers/seats on board, and the flight attendant, at first, said that this should be expected by passengers, and asked if I wanted to have cup noodle instead. Until later she said that was a mistake. She then offered me one sandwich and said to me that it supposed to be staff's meal but I can take it (any staff will have no meal during the flight?) I refused. Later on when they started to collect left-overs, miraculously, the flight attendant 'found' one meal and wanted to offer to me. This is disgusting. This is simply the worst experience ever.",3,2017-02-21,Hong Kong,False,review hong kong dubai blocked seat tried check online hr stuck seat assigned family four travelling together separated huge cannot move family sit together even close called customer service also raised concern social medium team feedback got passenger already checked ridiculous refused help staff told quite rude way paid lot better cabin second flight dubai hong kong ran food food food selection trolly reached asked happened since fixed number passenger seat board flight attendant first said expected passenger asked wanted cup noodle instead later said mistake offered one sandwich said supposed staff meal take staff meal flight refused later started collect left over miraculously flight attendant found one meal wanted offer disgusting simply worst experience ever
"✅ Verified Review |  To me, Emirates hasn't changed much since my last trip with them in 2013. It still offers free train ticket (in Germany) that connects your home to the airport. Flights from Munich to Beijing via Dubai were on-time. Onboard service was great with a good selection of food and alcoholic/non-alcoholic drinks. I went for some vodka and they served me Russian Standard, a premium vodka distilled in St. Petersburg. That was a pleasant surprise. The only downside of the trip was Munich airport. Emirates uses Munich's Terminal 1, which is very outdated and small, especially so when being compared to Munich airport's new Terminal 2. On our way back, at Munich there were only 3 immigration windows and a small luggage carousel for the 500 passengers from a fully packed A380.",5,2017-02-18,Germany,False,review emirate changed much since last trip still offer free train ticket germany connects home airport flight munich beijing via dubai time onboard service great good selection food alcoholic non alcoholic drink went vodka served russian standard premium vodka distilled st petersburg pleasant surprise downside trip munich airport emirate us munich terminal outdated small especially compared munich airport new terminal way back munich immigration window small luggage carousel passenger fully packed
"✅ Verified Review |  Larnaca to Malta. This is the only way to get to Malta from Cyprus and it isn't a bad option. Bought a coach ticket and a few days before EK sent an email for an upgrade to Business for Euro 320. One-way business fare is Euro 800 so I thought what the heck - I'll do it. You get neither the car service pick-up nor access to the business class lounge - it's stated when you buy the upgrade - but I think I wouldn't do it again as it's totally ridiculous not to give you lounge access. Check-in was friendly and flight boarded on-time. They use the 7-across business Boeing 777-300ER for this route which is false advertising as the upgrade email said lie-flat seats in private all aisle-access seating. But I had the seat next to me free and enjoyed the space. ICE is always the best of any airline so can't fault entertainment system. Service - the key point - was the downfall. The FA serving my side was lacking much personality, hard to get her to smile but I did manage it once. The male FA was mostly flirting with the lady passengers behind me and not until we lifted off did he come by and introduce himself. Food was average - had the same in coach on other airlines. Cabin was clean and again seat was comfortable for the 2 1/2 hour trip. Landed on time but priority bags came out last - which was a pain as I had a car waiting for over an hour after I landed.

"✅ Verified Review | Newcastle to Bahrain via Dubai. I have made 5 trips with Emirates in the last 15 months, made up of 20 flights. There has been a steady decline in quality and the service provided. It seems that Emirates is becoming a budget hub operator. The prices have stayed the similar, however with saver fares you must pay to select your seat before check in. This wouldn't be too bad, but Emirates don't allow the purchase of exit seats which is bad compared to other carriers. The choice of drinks onboard has decreased and certain routes have had snacks removed, which existed before. It seems the cabin crew are not as courteous as I first experienced and even seem slightly unprofessional. My biggest complaint is that they cancelled one of my flights, gave me an alternative that got me to my destination 24 hours late. After calling them they changed it to the earlier flight meaning I'd make my connection. The way they came across on the phone was that I should be grateful they changed it for free. Now I had a long connection in Dubai and asked for lounge access as a form of compensation, which they refused. They said waiving the cost of changing my flight was my compensation. Changing the flight in the first place was their fault. Also, when I landed in Bahrain it took nearly an hour and half for my luggage and there was still half the passengers waiting when I left. Overall, a budget choice if you have no other option.

Her solution was to give me an economy main course, and not having enough food to fulfil all requests is unacceptable. The staff seemed disorganised and some had a poor grasp of English. My wife and I asked two simple questions of the attendants, one did not know and the other did not understand and had to get a senior.

"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Perth via Dubai. Emirates do not care and customer service is a joke. I received a bland apology and they flatly denied I was booked in as vegetarian, something which I double checked as I booked through an agent. Unfortunately I was served vegan food, which was appalling. They tried to serve the same dreadful dishes twice on the same trip. Not the gourmet food promised on their website. The cabin crew did their best to rustle up something edible, but when I finally was served a vegetarian meal on the last flight of the trip - a meal which had been rejected by another passenger - it was a very hot, spicy chick pea meal with a raw chilli in it. Not everyone reacts well to hot spicy food and I am one of them. Dubai Airport is a disgrace - the customer service staff were surly and unhelpful. I was not advised that there was a business lounge nearer to my boarding gate, (the gate number was on the pass, so that would not have been difficult) resulting in a long, last minute dash to the gate. On the return flight, finding the correct lounge was nigh impossible, and I and another passenger had to ask a cleaner as no customer service staff were anywhere to be seen.

"✅ Verified Review |  Due to heavy fog at Gatwick on 23rd January I was unable to arrive into Gatwick from Copenhagen to make it to my Emirates flight.

"✅ Verified Review |  Very pleasant trip from Yangon to Manchester via Dubai. Pleased to see that there is a business class lounge in Yangon, shared with other airlines, as this is not mentioned on Emirates website. The lounge was very comfortable though with very limited food post-midnight. The cabin crew were very helpful on both legs of the journey and provided much better service on both legs than on recent trips. In particular, they accommodated a small bamboo stool (souvenir) that was marginally over the luggage dimensions though fitted OK into the larger overhead lockers (ground staff wanted to put it in the hold). They also greeted me by name on the DXB-MAN flight and offered to show me how all the seat / screen controls worked. The seats were very comfy on both the new Boeing 777 (RGN-DXB) and the older A380 (DXB-MAN). I asked to change my breakfast from Express to Continental and the cabin crew agreed immediately. The food is never exceptional on Emirates but it was tasty. The New Zealand Pinot Noir wine was excellent. The cabin crew were very attentive in bringing and removing towels / food and drink.

"✅ Verified Review |  Emirates was simply brilliant. I flew four flights with them in a week, London Heathrow to Mumbai via Dubai, returning from Delhi to London via Dubai, and all flights were perfect. The sector DEL to DXB was delayed as Delhi airport authorities decided to shut the airport for an hour due to national day preparations so we sat there for an hour meaning that the time at Dubai for connecting my onward flight was minimal. However Emirates pulled it out of the bag and I made my connecting flight and my bags were there at Heathrow as well! Despite flying economy my seat was comfortable with plenty of legroom, the entertainment was superb with thousands of films and TV programmes to watch and the food was fine.

"✅ Verified Review | Cape Town to Sydney via Dubai. Emirates has to be the worst airline I have ever travelled with. They state on your ticket that you are allowed 30kg of checked in baggage. However, when you check in this changes to two 23kg bags. Now because most passengers are over 23kg and are not in a position to buy a new bag at the airport, they let you ""get out"" of the dilemma by paying $75 (USA). Most passengers I met on board stated they had to pay this amount. When myself and the other passengers inquired about this amount to ground staff, we were all rudely told ""you need to read the fine print and that it a new Emirates policy"". I was also shouted at by the senior manager in Cape Town because I asked him to explain why this policy was in place. After we argued for almost 30 mins, he turned to the other ground staff and started laughing. They also ran out of food and I had to miss dinner despite paying for this service. Staff on board also don't seem to like their job as they don't respond to the assistance light and frequently forget what they told you. As a frequent traveller to all parts of the world, this is the worst airline I have ever flown. Emirates has become an arrogant airline which now seems to accept bad service and rude staff.

"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Brisbane via Dubai. Travelled on the evening flight from the UK, transitting Dubai mid morning with the Brisbane leg being a night flight. Good points - prompt chauffer service at both ends, good lounge at Gatwick with reasonable range of food, wide range of films and the entertainment system is available as soon as you board, heated towels at regular intervals, comfy seating with mattress topper for sleep, fast track security pass. Negatives - patchy on board service, untidy and tired looking plane on the Brisbane leg, lack of sleep suits. Major problem was the transfer at Dubai. Gatwick flight's arrival into Terminal A was delayed by over an hour due to fog. We then found that the Brisbane flight was leaving from Terminal B, a train ride away where the Business Lounge is much poorer than in A. Due to restricted time for transfer my wife did not use the shower facility, the gents was ok but tiny cubicle. Went to the Boarding Gate on time but plane was parked off stand on the other side of the airport. Bus transfer needed and chaos seemed to ensue. We were at least an hour in the lounge/queuing on the stairs - not acceptable for business customers. Plane was then delayed leaving Dubai and arrived at Brisbane about 2 hours late.

However, the Emirates website was not updated to include the courtesy layover package (visa on arrival / hotel) for the 14 hours we were forced to stay in the airport, waiting for our connection. We tried a lot to reason with the online customer service and ground staff but they refused to work around the issue. We were travelling with a 1 year old and it was a miserable 14 hours. After the long wait in the terminal, we had to board a 13 hour flight to New York which unnecessarily made our travel very hectic. There was an earlier flight to New York but ground staff refused.

"✅ Verified Review |  Pure nightmare. I travelled with a 4yrs old who has special needs. I was allocated a seat in the upper deck which is close to business class. My seat was changed a few minutes before boarding with this unbelievable reason “your child has autism so he can’t seat near the business area”! We were then moved to the lower deck to the end of the plane (from 27 to 87) where we could enjoy the toilet flushing sound throughout the 7hrs flight from Dubai to Birmingham. Not only that I was relying on my son’s pushchair as he gets tired walking long distance. They lost the first pushchair on the way to Dubai, texted me the next day and asked me to collect it, had to take taxi from Sharjah to Dubai, waited in the lost luggage office for hours to be told the text message was wrong and they haven’t yet found the pushchair. Ok, organized another pushchair and this was again lost on the way back to Birmingham. I have been calling their call center for the last 10 days, every time talked to a new person but same reply, “we will email Birmingham airport, they will get back to you”!

Catering standard was better than average, a great choice of drinks and wine etc. The bar at the back of the upper deck is a must do. A lot of passengers went to sleep, I was having fun with the crew counting down to the new year, a first for me on the air! If ever there was one minor imperfection, that would be the dining table of my seat, which was badly designed in a way, when opened and folded down, it cuts almost into my stomach (I am stocky).

"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London via Dubai. After being advised that I could change my flight for my return journey, I managed to find a flight earlier and tried to pay for the ticket using my UK card, (for which I got charged for a failed transaction), Two credit cards from India and failed. There was money in the accounts but they couldn't take the money. I was advised to bring in cash to the airport on the day of travel. So I painstakingly managed to get 20,000 Rupees when currency was scarce in India and took it to the airport. The rude woman over the phone at the airport Emirates office just said she couldn't take my money because the call centre people didn't put the amount to pay on the ticket but it was confirmed conditionally? Didn't get that logic at all. So I had to call the call centre after putting some more credit as the average call time for a call to Emirates is a minimum of half an hour to an hour. Then the manager comes on the phone and directs me to someone else in the airport. I was due to fly at 9:20pm and hadn't paid for my ticket until 7:15 pm. I was scared to death as I had to report to work the next day.  The casual and careless attitude of the Emirates airport staff didn't help relieve the tension.

"✅ Verified Review |  My flight from Dublin to Hong Kong via Dubai was pleasant. The flight is good value for money, cheaper than flights that I used to go on that connect through Heathrow. I felt the service was standard and comparable to other airlines I have flown long haul. The journey is split into two 8 hours flights with a layover between. Due to the timing of the dinner and breakfast service, getting a long period of rest was difficult. They were slow to turn off the cabin lights to allow passengers to rest. In the past when I went through Heathrow I felt the crew were quicker to serve the first meal and served the last meal much closer to landing, maximising the rest period. And they were quicker to turn off lights. In my second leg from Dubai to Hong Kong, a child had vomited at the back of the plane by the lavatory. The crew seemed to struggle to come up with a way to deal with it but they improvised in the end.

"✅ Verified Review |  Seattle to Thiruvananthapuram via Dubai.  I was travelling with my kids, which includes an infant. The staff on the flight from Seattle to Dubai were rude and non-cooperative. I requested for warm water to prepare some food for my kid and it was provided after 2 hrs even after me telling them in the first place that it is for the infant's meal. At the airport just before boarding they made a fuss about my one cabin baggage being 8 kg and wanted me to move the 1 kg to another bag even though the total weight of the baggage's were less than the allowed weight limit for 3 people.  I had requested special meals due to some dietary requirements. The tray was provided well before the meal was served to rest of the passengers. With a one year old how many hours can I handle the tray? On requesting the crew member to help me out by taking the tray the response was we cannot do it as we are serving other passengers. All of them responded in a very arrogant manner. The passenger who was sitting on the aisle seat was so accommodating that he agreed to switch seats with me seeing my plight. I had to go to the kitchen area to get warm water every single time with my little one. The screen in-front of my seat was not working. I just wanted it to be switched off. The crew member said it will be done in 5 minutes and that he will be back in 5 minutes. Apparently he came after 5 hrs. The airlines says that they take care of people who are travelling with kids which is not true. The other passengers (elder people) were so kind that they offered to hold the baby for a few minutes so that I can use the restroom. On our return flight, I had requested for gluten-free meal which was provided in the flight from TRV to Dubai but was denied on the flight from Dubai to Seattle stating that I had not made the choice, even though i had opted for it in all the flights to and fro.

"✅ Verified Review |  It would seem to me that Emirates have spent all their money on advertising and celeb associations while overlooking the upkeeping of their planes or training their staff. My return flight London to Melbourne was one of the worst flight related experiences I've been through and a huge disappointment. One half of the entertainment screen on the first leg of the journey (LHR to DXB) was unresponsive so I gave up on trying to watch anything. The provided headphones are awful, and you can't use you own because of the archaic two ports stereo jack they work with. The food was simply awful on 4 of the 5 flight legs on my journey. Apart from the crackers and cheese, I ate next to nothing. Airport staff are incredibly slow at doing anything. Just one example: boarding our connecting flight in Singapore, they chose to guide all the 800 or so passengers onto the plane by having a junior member of staff hold boards with the boarding zones up. If you haven't been in the Singapore airport before, you'll probably not know that a huge part of the seating area at the boarding gate is behind the counter, so if you were sitting there, you couldn't see the boards at all, while another member of staff was trying to shout what zones were being boarded when. This confused a lot of people, that simply couldn't hear or see what was being announced. The worst is yet to come, as our return flight MEL to DXB was delayed by two hours due to fog on an earlier flight, this made us miss our connecting flights in Dubai. You'd think that, with such a big airline as Emirates everything would be fine as they surely have other flights to go onto. You would be wrong though, we were rebooked onto a flight the next morning, so 45 people on the London flight alone were stuck in Dubai for a full day.

However, flight from Islamabad to Dubai was ok even though the airplane was not very clean. Staff was cooperative. But as soon as we landed in Dubai, we were like stranded. There was no counter or any staff to help us or guide us. The fellow passengers were helpful enough to guide us. We had 18 hrs connecting flight to Bologna.

Finally when we found the counter and asked for hotel room, Emirates staff was rude and denied us room. Finally, seeing condition of my mother I offered to pay for the room. Even then, the woman sitting on counter said her shift was over and she wont help us out; we should wait till after 5 (our flight landed in Duabi at 3:00PM). After waiting for almost an hour the Emirates took around 1100 Dirhams from us for one night stay (visa fee included). But all this process took around 4 hrs as we reached hotel at 7:30 PM , extremely exhausted.

Once airside, boarding was not announced until 13:45 and flight departed at 15:00. There were many Emirates staff hanging around at the gate but no one bothered to make an announcement. Clearly Bangkok's gate holding lounges are not designed to accommodate a full load of A380 passengers and it was jam packed. No effort was made by the Emirates ground staff to separate passengers. Boarding at the beginning was a free flow until several very sultry ground staff restored order. Once on board, cabin crew was cold. The lady responsible for the area I sat in was very rude with people that do not speak fluent English when distributing the 'meal' (tasteless and cold curry chicken rice) and if you dare to ask her for something she does not have in the trolley (Diet Coke for example), the request would fall on deaf ear. Despite such rudeness, service was slow and inefficient. They only served the meal one hour after take off and barely managed to collect the trays at top of descent.

So they get your money but then you can't even sit together. Absolute joke Emirates. Needless to say we won't ever use Emirates again. We will stick to our usual airline in future.

So when we arrived in Krabi minus our luggage because that was left in Bangkok due to the late arrival our our Dubai flight I emailed Emirates only to be told it could have been operational reasons we were bumped, but I feel really strongly that we are being fobbed off by them. Why bother giving you the option to book seats then move you anyway. What makes another passenger better than me and why should they get the seat I'd booked all those months in advance. I have since replied to them and asked the question again. I think the cabin crew are not as attentive as they used to be either. I know to some people the seat saga is petty but it's a big thing to me. All I hope is we get the seats we booked on our return flights.

"✅ Verified Review |  Birmingham to Bangkok via Dubai. This was my first long haul flight, which I did alone so I was very apprehensive about luggage being transferred, reaching connections in time and the flight in general. I was pretty happy with everything overall. The seats were comfy, I ended up with a window seat with two empty seats next to me, which was great. The entertainment system was brilliant. Lots to choose from. The wifi didn't work too well, but that wasn't an issue. The staff were very polite and helpful, blankets, wet towels, warm towels, pillows and headphones all supplied. The food wasn't amazing but wasn't an issue either. The only thing I wasn't impressed with were the ground staff at Dubai. No one was particularly helpful when I asked about my luggage being transferred.

"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to London via Dubai. Emirates is one of our favourite airlines. We have flown economy with them several times to Asia as well as to South Africa. We like their service, find the seats comfortable and have never experienced problems with the excellent ICE system. I hardly ever sleep on planes and find it comforting to have so much good entertainment during the long flights. We like the food. We have always had good experience with check-in, boarding and disembarkment. So when I had an accident during our last trip to Thailand and broke my ankle, I was fitted with an Aircast so that I could fly home. My insurance was taking care of everything but the one thing they refused, no matter how many times I asked or even with a written statement from my doctor, was to upgrade my husband so that he could be by my side during the long and uncomfortable journey home. I was unable to walk unaided and therefore needed personal assistance. I was upgraded to Business Class, which would have been a great experience under any other circumstances. As it was I daren't eat or drink much of what was on offer (all looked delicious) out of fear of being caught short bathroom wise. The Bangkok to Dubai leg in Business Class was full admittedly, but the Dubai to Gatwick leg was only half occupied.

"✅ Verified Review |  I took a first class ticket Dubai to Kuwait, but overall I was disappointed with the experience. First, my chauffeur driver never informed the hotel that he was waiting for me outside as I instructed EK to do so via my telephone conversation in Dubai. I had no idea he was waiting for me outside. The first class check-in experience was not as tremendous as I anticipated. Basically there was attention given to me, but I never felt like a first class passenger. They let me check-in in the express check-in counter as opposed to the first class counter. The food and service provided in the first class lounge in concourse A is unacceptable. Not only was the food tasteless, but it takes a very long time to prepare something for me from a la carte menu. For example, it took approximately 10 - 15 minutes to provide me my club sandwich, and 15 - 20 minutes to provide me the ""um ali"" sweet. All this while the lounge was empty. While I was waiting for my food the waiter asked me what I wanted to drink and I told him water, he kept goofing around and I chased him until he gave me my water. This is unacceptable for first class service. During boarding business class passengers entered door 1A with us as opposed to door 2A, thus ruining the exclusive experience of first class. Upon disembark, business class passengers were trying to skip queue and leave the aircraft before first class passengers do.  I will not be flying Emirates first class again and will look for alternatives such as Qatar Airways.",8,2016-12-27,Kuwait,False,review took first class ticket dubai kuwait overall disappointed experience first chauffeur driver never informed hotel waiting outside instructed ek via telephone conversation dubai idea waiting outside first class check experience tremendous anticipated basically attention given never felt like first class passenger let check express check counter opposed first class counter food service provided first class lounge concourse unacceptable food tasteless take long time prepare something la carte menu example took approximately minute provide club sandwich minute provide um ali sweet lounge empty waiting food waiter asked wanted drink told water kept goofing around chased gave water unacceptable first class service boarding business class passenger entered door u opposed door thus ruining exclusive experience first class upon disembark business class passenger trying skip queue leave aircraft first class passenger flying emirate first class look alternative qatar airway
✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to London via Dubai. Wasn't the greatest experience with Emirates - check in was a headache. We were 8 kilos overweight between two of us and they charged us for the excess. Boarding was fine and seats comfortable but they feel a little claustrophobic. The staff were good. My wife was charmed by her attendant but I got the feeling my attendant thought she was doing me a favour by serving me. It doesn't cost any thing and takes minimal effort to smile when talking to a customer. Meals were only served within a timeslot so you couldn't eat when you wanted to and weren't really up to expectations. The champagne wasn't served cold enough. I had to return 3 glasses and in the end I went to the bar myself to make sure. The bar itself was a bit of a disappointment but maybe we were too tired to appreciate it. The seat has an area with a selection of soft drinks which you can access yourself. Unfortunately its protective frame needed two arms to prise up and then the drinks weren't cold so I had to call for ice. The entertainment system was a bit tricky to operate and took a little while to work the IFE. The upper deck of business class probably had 100 passengers in total and felt a little overwhelming.  I felt that there were not enough attendants for the number they were taking care of. There were 4 loos between us but the loos were just a bit larger than the economy toilets and disappointing. I couldn't use one because it was too messed up. When we landed no attendant offered to help my wife with her luggage from the overhead locker but it was nice to have our own upper deck exit way. On reading through this I do sound a bit like a spoiled brat and complaining over small things. But if some airlines can get these right so why not Emirates?

"✅ Verified Review |  This was the 2nd leg of our journey from Gatwick to Ho Chi Minh City with Emirates, the first having been on a A380. We arrived in the morning local time and left in the morning local time. The food on the first leg was ok - not brilliant, but not awful just average. When we got on the next flight we were served a seafood lunch, at 9 am (ish) local time or 6 am as per our body clocks. Needless to say it remained untouched. Can't fathom why a lunch was served so early in the day. The bus from terminal to plane was extraordinarily long and seemed to take for ever but was most definitely at least 20-25 mins. The aircraft itself was definitely very dated and the seats far from the best. All in all it was a distinctly average experience and isn't likely to encourage us to use Emirates in the future. Having said all of that it was relatively cheap for Business class so I guess in this instance you sort of get what you pay for.

"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Maldives via Dubai. Emirates was highly recommended to us but all I can say is it was a big disappointment and we are dreading our return flight with them. Positives - polite staff, seats comfortable. Negatives - service and amenities. Husband not able to use IFE controls as it had jammed. We ordered two courses as suggested on the menu booklet for a light eater. Waited one and half hours after first course for cheese (we ordered with our starter as we did not want the main course) - told that it had all gone as they had served everyone else in the cabin, even those behind us. After showing our displeasure, they did make up for this by getting us some cheese and offering good wine from first class. Why not offer this in first place rather than telling us the cheese had gone? On a long flight that arrives at night (2am), we wanted to sleep - not an amenity bag in sight. I asked for one and was told they only supply on night flights. Well I'm sorry but when I board and arrive somewhere early in the morning then I expect an amenity bag. That is night time and that is when you require those bits and pieces that add a little (paid for) luxury to the start of a hard earned holiday. Having paid thousands for business I do not expect an airline to be so stingy - they should supply amenity bags regardless of time of flying. People do need to wash and clean teeth and freshen up during any long haul flight. This is appalling cost cutting meanness and sorry I thought my thousands in air fare bought me a small bag of comfort. I have flown business with other airlines and received much better service. I was so excited to fly with Emirates as I heard good reports, but they will not be my first choice again really not good value for money.

"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Mauritius return via Dubai. We have flown round the world with various airlines, but this was the first time with Emirates. It was so comfortable, the in-seat entertainment the best we have seen and the staff, both in the air and on the ground, were helpful. We spent twenty eight hours on four flights and the staff did everything they could to make us comfortable. The check in staff were friendly and the process swift and easy. Their uniforms are smart and professional. Boarding was simple and, because there were three gangways, one to upstairs, it was quick. The A380 is quiet. The food was very good. The lighting onboard was perfect. During night hours it's a dark gently blue ceiling with twinkling stars. At dawn, it is exactly that. The entertainment system. Three external camera views and one little oddity that I found a complete Godsend. On the music section, I found a sleep hypnosis track by Anna Rowe. My mistake was putting it on ""repeat"" because some way into it, I had gone. But then when it started again, it woke me up! The seats were comfortable and a good non-intrusive recline. The usual cushion, blanket, headphones etc. If you bring your own headphones/noise cancellers etc, make sure enough bring the double-plug airline adaptor with you because their headphone sockets are dual-plug. You can use your mobile, get data and charge devices. The plane has its own mobile service for you to connect to, watch out though, it's not cheap, so best to go on airline mode in case your phone auto-cones and someone rings you from home.

"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Sao Paulo via Dubai. From the chauffeur pick-up and drop to boarding, the experience was very smooth. The cabin was lit with mood lighting and both long haul aircraft had the StarLight, unique to Emirates, a feature I find amazing - to lie down and look at stars while you fly! Cabin crew service differed on the long hauls, inconsistency is the name of the game for cabin service in Emirates. The crew from Rio to Dubai could not do enough for you while the attendant on the Dubai to Sao Paulo leg was asking passengers to lift out the tables for dining! The seat itself is comfortable in a lie-flat position but has terribly limited storage. The IFE is fantastic. What Emirates misses is the dine-on-demand on ultra long hauls and pyjamas.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Dubai. Had heard great things about the airline and my wife and I were looking forward to the flight/holiday. What a disappointment. The headphone jack was not working, the recline button on my seat was not working. The seat itself was not completely fixed. It kept slipping.  When the food arrived, my main course looked like it had been opened and it wasn't even hot. Some passengers could not have their first choice meal. When we landed in Dubai, we had to be bussed to the terminal. The return flight was worse. Seating in the middle of the middle row (seats E/F) is definitely a mistake. The cabin staff seemed oblivious to us. They kept missing us when the drinks were being offered. (we only wanted a cup of tea!). They even forgot to ask us for their headphones and blankets at the end of the flight. There was hardly anytime between the main meal and snacks. We found one or two of the cabin staff who served us rather unprofessional.  All in all, a pretty disappointing experience.  The A380 is an excellent aeroplane and hats off to the pilot and his crew but I feel that the cabin staff could not handle the number of passengers it can carry.

Flew Emirates from Melbourne to Auckland. Seat 23K on upper deck of the A380 rear cabin. This leg was upgraded to Business by invitation, thus I was not eligible to access the lounge, which was fine. Upon boarding, ground crew saw my Boarding Pass and allowed me to enter the waiting area, which led to early boarding, that was quite nice. The cabin was almost empty to the point I was the only seating passenger at the rear. Crew members were all overly friendly and took their turns to greet me individually by remembering my surname - I never felt so spoiled. One flight attendant even handed me an amenity kit, which was not complementary for such a short hop across the Tasman. Bar service was exceptional as well, I was invited to have a drink and talk to the crew members, who are not shy at smiling towards the passengers and being professional at the same time. Breakfast was tasty, signature sweets were particularly delicious. I consumed two bottles of drink from the mini bar, and it was replenished in-flight. WiFi was slow and hard to use. The cabin flown was not fitted with the airlines' brand new products, edges and corners have started showing some tiny wear and tear - this was the only drawback that I am able to think of. The crew members deserve the highest praise, I felt that they walked the extra mile to maintain a conversation with me, just like being with friends.

"Glasgow to Bangkok return via Dubai. Check in good in all airports. I'm Skywards Silver, so boarding is good. All flights pretty much on time but arrival in DXB and having to bus from a remote stand to the terminal is nonsense. As usual variable standards from the cabin crew - infrequent drinks runs and disorganised meal service resulting in myself and another passenger, not even being offered a meal - it's not exactly very complicated, and the flight was only half full.

Call bells were left unanswered throughout both flights with passengers resorting to self service to get a drink. No drinks runs other than with the meal. Seat pitch and width has also been reduced downstairs compared to the 3 class A380 (no doubt to cram more seats in). Emirates service has noticeably deteriorated over the last 12 months.

The aircraft's are in impeccable shape and the usual, low, levels of noise with the A380. Comfortable flight in both cases. It has been noted that the FA quality can be variable. On these two flights the FA's were pretty good and attentive. One with Emirates is that they have their FA's clean up the cabins. That means collecting rubbish, blankets, headphones, whatever is not tied down. It bugs me as I just do not think it is a good look for the airline to have their staff act as cleaners and rubbish collectors. That is the job of the ground crew and its messy to look at with bags of blankets walking up and down the aisles. The IFE is less good than you think.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick to Dubai return. The Emirates A380 is huge, quiet and with a brilliant in-flight entertainment system, only let down by the headphones. So my advice is but a two pin adaptor and wear your owns to get the full benefit. But that's where it ends. On both the outbound and return legs, the inflight service was terrible. Slow to the point of lazy, a choice of menu that's undeliverable by the time they've reached the middle of the flight, staff who offer little by the way of a solution when asked what's possible and disinterested in passenger comfort. I had to wait 40 minutes for a meal to be offered to me after I asked for a different main course to what was available in the trolley, and then it was the same meal I had declined. I asked to speak to the cabin manager twice, who finally arrived 10 mins later to apologize. On the return flight, the experience was much the same. No choice of menu for over half the passengers, two hours into flight before offered a drink and my meal arrived 50 minutes (!) after my wife's vegetarian ""choice"" was offered to her. This was labelled Vegan which isn't what was ordered and then another 10 minutes debate occurred with the cabin crew who said that there was nothing else available unless she wanted to wait until the end of service to see what was ""left"". When I was finally presented with the remaining meal choice (chicken with olive sauce) I had to ask for a drink, and the steward said the drinks trolley was on its way - it was half the length of the plane away! Somehow other passengers were given drinks with their meals, but we at the ""back"" were treated as an after thought. The passengers behind us had exactly the same experience. A note of advice for Emirates. Olives are a divisive ingredient, people either like or dislike olives so if you include a meal with olives, more people will avoid it than choose it! Leaving you short of choice! The overhead luggage cabin had crew luggage which they proceeded to access a number of times during the flight - constantly bumping my head as they reached up. On one occasion, the stewardess walked off and left it open for 10 minutes before coming back to close it. So my overriding impression of the airline is that it needs to improve quality of service on a human level. It's all very well having the latest aeroplane but if passenger experience is based on what's on tv, and food and drink service is a secondary concern, I for one won't fly with them again.",5,2016-11-07,United Kingdom,False,review london gatwick dubai return emirate huge quiet brilliant flight entertainment system let headphone advice two pin adaptor wear owns get full benefit end outbound return leg inflight service terrible slow point lazy choice menu undeliverable time reached middle flight staff offer little way solution asked possible disinterested passenger comfort wait minute meal offered asked different main course available trolley meal declined asked speak cabin manager twice finally arrived min later apologize return flight experience much choice menu half passenger two hour flight offered drink meal arrived minute wife vegetarian choice offered labelled vegan ordered another minute debate occurred cabin crew said nothing else available unless wanted wait end service see left finally presented remaining meal choice chicken olive sauce ask drink steward said drink trolley way half length plane away somehow passenger given drink meal back treated thought passenger behind u exactly experience note advice emirate olive divisive ingredient people either like dislike olive include meal olive people avoid choose leaving short choice overhead luggage cabin crew luggage proceeded access number time flight constantly bumping head reached one occasion stewardess walked left open minute coming back close overriding impression airline need improve quality service human level well latest aeroplane passenger experience based tv food drink service secondary concern one fly
"✅ Verified Review | Arriving in to Delhi from Kuala Lumpur, I was in the transit zone to catch my flight the next morning with Emirates with a final destination to Lisbon. I had no checked luggage and warned Emirates prior leaving (early that morning) of my arrival in order to allow for a smooth transfer and me to check-in at the hotel in Delhi Terminal 3. I have previously done this with multiple airlines without any issues. AirAsia, a budget airline, ensured that I would be brought to the transit area and confirmed twice (additionally to my early confirmation) with Emirates staff in Delhi that I would be arriving. Upon getting to the transit zone (escorted by AirAsia staff), I was told that Emirates staff should be there and that they would assist me. It took 30 minutes for someone to show up. Needing a ticket to pass the security in the transit area, the Emirates staff had to go and print it outside; so I was told. I was expecting this to be already printed upon my arrival as everyone was warned. This not being that case, I was told that it could be arranged in 15 minutes. It took a total of 6hrs during which I was told constantly every hour that it will be another 15 minutes by Emirates staff. I couldn't sleep all night and obviously didn't get to the hotel in terminal 3. On top of this, no upgrade was available on the flight to allow me to get a bed when when I was promised by staff that I could do this at the gate counter. Some staff were completely incompetent by either constantly pointing at other individuals saying that they couldn't help me or giving wrong information. Overall, I can say that this has been by far the most unpleasant experience I have had with an airline which ruined the first 2 days of my 1 week holiday in Portugal.

"✅ Verified Review | Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt via Dubai with Emirates. This perhaps is my worst flight experience ever. My flight and seat was booked and confirmed 3 months in advance. When arriving back at Dubai airport for my Dubai - Frankfurt flight EK045, they informed me that the flight was over booked and refused me check-in despite arriving more than 2 hours before departure because I did not do online check-in. Apparently my seat has been allocated to another passenger. They offered me the next available flight and free ticket but I refused as I was traveling with my colleagues and had to be in Frankfurt for a meeting. The customer service said that I have to wait until check in is closed to see whether is there any available seat. After waiting until almost boarding time, they finally allocated me a seat and ask me to rush to the gate. Onboard, I checked in my coat and went to the allocated the seat 65C which is right next to the lavatory. Throughout the entire 6.5 hour journey, it was just horrible. I'm entirely fine with me with people going in and out of the toilet. But every half and hour or so, someone and somehow loss their sense direction and came knocking into me. Just before landing, I press the assistance button to retrieve my coat. Nobody answered. Upon landing, I immediately walked up to a stewardess asking for my coat and she said I had to wait until all the passengers leave so that they can bring it up from the back of the plane. I mean, this returning of the coats or whatever should be done naturally before the plane lands and need not to be instructed.

"✅ Verified Review |  In short: Unprofessional and rude cabin service, awful meals, dirty cabin, and most annoying is that the cabin crew just don't seem to care about anything. I'm a frequent traveler (usually every other week on CX or MY) I only choose Emirates since the kids wanted to travel on an A380 from Bangkok to Hong Kong. We had seats 52H/J/K next to the galley, to say passengers may find the noise from the galley troublesome is a huge understatement. Firstly, the galley is brightly lit and lights shine directly on you, they don't use a curtain. Even if you block the light with a mask you have the noise, lots of noise, if it's not the constant banging of the galley cupboard doors it's the cabin crew talking. Meals were low grade and poor quality. Meal service took forever and was completely unorganized, my special meal arrived and then was promptly removed never to return. 50 minutes later I was offered a regular meal. Condensation from the galley freezers made the floor soaking wet in front of and below our seats - the crew explained this always happens and covered the area in blankets. ICE system is good, but the headphones are a perfect example of form over function - who has square ears?

I was excited to fly on Emirates and try out their new amenities in the Business cabin including the bar and space to move around. However on the day of the journey I find out that instead of the A380 the aircraft was now a Boeing 777-300ER. A much smaller plane. Instead of the spacious and luxurious Business cabin they had changed our seats - it was now 2-3-2 with some of the business seats having no direct aisle access. I was in the window seat so was stuck trying to get to the aisle on both legs of my journey. The seats seemed a bit worn out, the IFE control a bit heavy and clunky and it was not a lie-flat seat, which on such a long journey is a huge problem. I hated the trip and felt completely let down.

"✅ Verified Review |  London to Johannesburg via Dubai. It was our first flight with Emirates and we had high expectations . Although our seats had been booked prior to arrival at the airport we were advised to change them by the check in clerk who said we would have four seats between two of us in one particular row. This was not so. Although we passed one man who was stretched out across several seats to himself, the two other seats in our new row were occupied by the largest lady on the aircraft plus her hand luggage. It happened to be my birthday on the day that we flew and I must say it spoiled my birthday somewhat. When we flew two days later from Dubai to Johannesburg, boarding staff asked how my birthday had gone, I replied that since she had brought it up it had been spoiled by the events during the previous flight. I was then told to request a particular row on this flight where we could have better seats as some way of recompense. When we boarded the plane once again, we were let down and the seats were not available. I tweeted and complained formally to Emirates about this. It actually took them 32 days to reply and that was after prompting and more tweeting. Many tweets and private messages on Twitter were actually ignored.

"✅ Verified Review |  I have been flying with Emirates for business and leisure for over 10 years and have only flown Economy class where I have found the service to be of excellent standards. Recently I was offered the option to upgrade to business class and I decided to pay the additional premium. The service I received during my flight was disappointing, and quite substandard. Dubai to Manchester the journey began really well. After 15 minutes into the flight my TV and all electrical equipment failed to work which meant I couldn't not watch TV, close the blinds or switch off the overhead light. I made the cabin staff aware of this and was advised that she would reset the TV and this would resolve the issue. One hour had passed and none of the faults had been fixed. On my way to the toilets, I raised the concern once again and was advised that the reset would be done again and that it should resolve the issue. I sat patiently waiting throughout the meal service without any form of entertainment. I then decided to lay back my seat and get some rest and was constantly annoyed by the overhead light which I could not turn off. 2 hours had passed and a second cabin staff came by asking me to leave my seat so she could reset the electrical switches which were located under my seat. This was done twice without any positive result. The service I received in business class became anything but relaxing. Almost 3.5 hours into the flight and half way through my journey I was offered the chance to move to another seat which I found unacceptable and a little too late in the day. I emailed the customer affairs department and they offered me 25,000 air miles which amount to nothing. I cannot even get an upgrade! Really disappointed with Emirates and the way they have dealt with this. I do not recommend flying Emirates Business class, really not worth the extra money you pay.

"✅ Verified Review |  Guangzhou to London via Dubai. The best thing about Emirates is their cabin crew who are excellent. The worst thing is their business class seats which are appalling on their older A380's. To get into the seat is very tight unless you are a fashion model, if you are anything but a model then the tray that pulls out for eating is just crazy - I would need to lose at least 3 stone to be able to use it. It will not go past my tummy and what pregnant women would do is just beyond me. On the later A380's they have changed this tray realising that their first effort was hopeless and very badly designed. However their is very little space in this business class seat and I was very disappointed. Travelling often on business to the Far East this has to be the worst seat I have ever sat in.

"✅ Verified Review |  I flew with Emirates from Brisbane to London return via Dubai. The staff were sour, acting like my asking for a glass of water were a hassle, and the food was disgusting. But the flight over was nothing compared to the return journey. After not being notified that my flight was delayed due to a plane crash at Dubai airport (ever heard of email, Emirates?), I arrived at the airport to start my journey home and finally found someone to guide me to a customer service desk, where I was told of the delay and given a hotel and bus voucher. The customer service agent also told me that the next leg of my flight would be organised when I was in the air - someone would meet me at the gate (I scoffed at that one). Trying to get on the bus was like surviving a round of the hunger games, after an hour I gave up and caught a cab. After spending 14 hours in the hotel I thought I would be winging my way home. After finally arriving in Dubai, there was no one there to meet me at the gate so I proceeded to the transfer desk, where I was told by someone who had just been served that the queue wait time was 7 hours. So after waiting for 3 hours I found staff who told me that if my online booking had been updated with my next flight, then I shouldn't bother waiting in the queue as they weren't giving out hotel or meal vouchers.  I checked online and found that I had indeed been put on a flight - scheduled to leave in 24 hours time. I settled in to spend 28 hours total in Dubai airport with the other people laying on pieces of cardboard and crates.  On my return to Australia, Emirates refused any compensation for breaching their contract by not providing any accommodation or meal vouchers and now ""considered the matter closed"", refusing to respond to any further emails. So if you're looking to fly Emirates - beware!

"✅ Verified Review |  Glasgow to Melbourne via Dubai with Emirates. On the GLA-DXB sector, the Boeing 777-300ER was just 11 months old, clean, tidy and with impressive IFE. We had chosen the back of the plane where the window seats are in twos and would recommend this for couples; it felt spacious and comfortable. The 3-4-3 layout of the rest of the economy cabin did look very cramped however. These seats at the back put you close to the toilets but did not find it to be an issue, however you are at the back of the queue for meals which meant I was lucky to get my choice (FA had to go and find me a chicken tandoori). The long Dubai to Melbourne sector had us in seats A and B of the 3-4-3 economy layout; this felt much more cramped and uncomfortable, and will avoid in future. The A380 was slightly older, with the older style of IFE which was not altogether functional; my partner's screen was buggy and only one headphone worked. There was not much staff could do about this except change her seat which would have meant splitting us up. The A380 had WiFi but it was so slow as to be practically unusable for anything more than sending WhatsApp messages. Food on both flights was excellent, both for me (normal diet) and my partner (vegetarian-lacto-ovo). The crew made a few soft drinks runs but could have been more frequent, particularly on the longer sector. There are complimentary beverages on Emirates but the crew seemed so busy you didn't feel welcome to order one outside the meal runs. The crew were mainly pleasant but could have been a bit more welcoming and enthusiastic, as I said above you didn't really feel overly welcome or waited upon (it's not their main job but it's nice to be looked after). Check-in staff at Glasgow were helpful, pleasant and efficient, but we were caught unawares by the strict (weighed at check-in) 7kg carry-on limit. Unfortunately our biggest issue was with some damage to my partner's case which meant that it could no longer be rolled and will need to be repaired/replaced.

"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to New York JFK. This is our first time traveling in business class on an A380-800, when we first booked our tickets we specifically requested special assistance for my husband who is in the wheelchair and unable to stand. When we arrived at the check-in counter, we asked for confirmation that special assistant would be provided at the gate to help my husband board the aircraft using an isle chair. An hour before boarding we asked the agent on duty if they had all the necessary preparation that we had asked for. In all 3 instances we were assured that everything was under control. So we relax, believing that everything was under control. However when it came time to board we were forced to wait at the aircraft door until all passenger had been boarded because no preparation had been made to assist my husband into the aircraft. At this point the flight crew apologized to us for the confusion and inconvenience. After another 20 mins waiting we accessed the business class section on the upper deck using hilift truck (typically use for catering) from which we boarded the aircraft and were moved to our seat location. Unfortunately there were no moveable armrest on any of the business class seats that would enable a wheelchair bound passenger to transfer from the isle chair to the seat without risking injury. Fortunately my husband is strong enough to transfer over the arm rest without falling down or injuring himself (perhaps they are no fully accessible first or business class seats on Emirates), everything else from that point on until we disembarked was excellent!

"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Perth.  A new plane, nicely decorated and kitted out. The seats had a decent width and pitch and  the IFE and onboard connectivity are always good. Unfortunately, the cushion and blanket are small, tatty and hardly comforting or warm. There was no drinks service until after the main meal was served. The selection of beverages was lacking and the quality of drinks seemed cheap. It was, however, the meal service that really stood out as a real disappointment.  On this route we were to 'enjoy' two hot meals. I have included photos as I don't think I could adequately describe how bad these meals were in words alone. The best part of the whole meal service was looking around the cabin and seeing the faces of fellow passengers do the big unveil on their hot meals. Priceless! Luckily Emirates do provide cheese and crackers and chocolate to partly make up for the rest of the meal. The crew service was professional and generally friendly, but I feel like the crew are trying so hard to get the service right that they fail to engage with passengers. They appear unnatural and don't let their personalities shine through. The flight boarded quickly, took off on time and landed into Perth only a few minutes behind schedule.

"✅ Verified Review |  Geneva to Taipei via Dubai. I don't recommend Emirates and I will avoid to fly with Emirates moving forward. The flight I took from Dubai to Taipei was delayed for more than 6 hours. I arrived Dubai around 1AM and departed at 10AM. During this period of long-waiting time, Emirates didn't make up anything for us. There was no meal voucher, no nothing. I won't rate its service as good as its reputation. It is pretty poor actually. Secondly, during my whole itinerary, I had to take shuttle for at least 4 times. It was either from flight to terminal, or from terminal to flight. It's definitely not a pleasant experience because my wife and I had to wait in a jammed, hot bus, and the transit time was long. I travel average 8-10 times a year and fly various airlines worldwide.

No one even bothered to ask whether we need anything for the baby - when I asked a crew member I need to make formula for the baby she asked me to wait till the service over, that is for another half an hour. Can a baby wait like an adult. I wanted to wash her milk bottle and she asked me to go to the washroom. No helping hand at all. Luckily I had my parents with me to help.

"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Sao Paulo return via Dubai. From the chauffeur service to the boarding experience, I could find no fault. The lounge in Delhi airport is quite big, well stocked and comfortable. All flights were on time and thankfully not via remote bay in Dubai. Some of the crew on certain legs were fantastic while others fail to make a mark remaining within borders of being professional and nothing else. The crew on the Sao Paulo to Dubai leg were fabulous - very warm and attentive. On ultra long haul flights, the seats seem to recline a lot more on a lie-flat arrangement. Hot towels, Bvglari amenity kits, very soft and warm blankets and well stocked washrooms await onboard on these ultra long haul flights. Some of the cabins had the StarLight belongs only to Emirates - bringing a great mood in flight. Emirates, while being a great airline, has inconsistent cabin service onboard which is surprising. The ICE entertainment system was spectacular - the best in the skies. What I give it to Emirates for is their food and it's quality - marvelous! There are 3 meals on the 14 hour leg - in addition to main meals, there is a light bite service. Due to the lack of on demand dining, they have snacks in the galley in between for the hungry.

"✅ Verified Review |  Johannesburg to New York JFK via Dubai. There was a total of 7 of us travelling on 2 separate bookings (6 people on 1 booking, 1 on another). Our flights home beginning on August 3, 2016 had us travelling with British Airways, Emirates and JetBlue Airways. We had no issues with our flights on British Airways and Jet Blue. Our luck ran out upon dealing with Emirates for our return flight home. I called Emirates August 2, 2016 (24 hours prior to our flight) to request kids meals and a vegan meal for 3 of our passengers. While on the phone with the representative, I inquired on our current seating arrangements to ensure the children would be sitting with the adults in our party. When I provided the booking number for my husband, I was advised his ticket was cancelled. You can imagine my shock upon hearing this. I asked the representative why it was cancelled, who cancelled it and when. I was advised it was cancelled July 24 – 1 day after we started travelling – and 6 months after booking the flight. The representative advised Emirates cancelled the ticket as they saw 2 tickets for a Brett Hale. My son’s name is BH Jr and my husband is BH. There is no space to enter a suffix within the Travelocity website. However, it is noted that one ticket was a child’s ticket and one was for an adult. In addition, I had to input the date of birth for each traveler.I never once received a phone call or email from Emirates to confirm I did in fact book a duplicate ticket. And I did not receive a refund for the cost of a ticket that they cancelled. After the representative informed me that Emirates made the error in cancelling my husband’s booking, I requested his ticket to be reinstated as it was, so we would all be travelling together. I was told that the second leg was full and that wasn’t an option. While informing the representative that that was not acceptable and that Emirates needed to find a way to ensure my husband was travelling with us, I was told he would send an email on an “Urgent Basis” and someone would be in touch with me. At this point, it is 7pm and the first leg of our flight home (via British Airways) is at 8am. I had been on the phone with him for over an hour. We were in a game reserve in the middle of South Africa and my cell phone did not have service. He advised I could try calling back in an hour. Long story short, it took over 4 hours and multiple phone calls to multiple people to get his ticket reinstated. Even then, I was not confident he would be flying home with us.

"✅ Verified Review |  Mauritius to Dubai. Our problems began with the meal service. We waited nearly half an hour from first to main course, but it was when the main course arrived that things really went downhill. The menu promised ""Braised beef brisket served in a rich jus with mashed potatoes and turned root vegetables"". What was served up with a barely warm meal with a dried up chunk of meat minus any jus. Judge for yourself from the photo. When I drew the attention of one of the cabin crew to this, she apologised and said she would find out what had gone wrong and come back to me. 20 minutes went by with no one coming back, so I pressed the call button, which was completely ignored (this in itself is worrying as it may have been an urgent matter that needed crew attention). I finally collared the purser as he was passing, got another apology and an explanation that all the beef meals were minus the sauce and offer of the same again but heated up. When I declined, explained that my partner and I were allergic to fish ruling that alternative out and didn't like curry, the other alternative, he said he would go away and see what else he could come up with. Five minutes later and the offer was beneath contempt - the purser brought the fish and curry meals I'd already rejected and two other dried up meals from economy. He then, very reluctantly said he'd see if there was anything else available from first class and claimed that they had the same meals so there was nothing he could do. I decided to pass and go the the sweet course (15 minutes waiting for that) while my partner decided not to eat at all. For the remainder of the flight, the cabin crew did their best to ignore us, or when they had to interact, their manner was off hand to say the least. Customer focus was lacking completely. The purser came past later and apologised but sincerity was lacking completely. About 30 minutes from landing, my partner pressed the call button to request the return of his jacket which had been hung up. Again, the call button was ignored completely. This was the worst flight I have had. By contrast, the connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester had an outstanding cabin crew and provided a superb flight experience. However, this is not the first time I've found a lack of consistency with Emirates, but it will be the last time.

"✅ Verified Review |  Emirates has lost it's edge with series of unnecessary changes over the last few years. If traveling to first world destinations, Emirates provide their latest aircraft, with state of the art features and polished services. However, take a flight to a not so developed destination and you are better off flying one of the budget airlines in the sector as there isn't much difference between the services and a whole lot to gain in the price. Flying to London heathrow on their A380 you would expect the best and unfortunately it failed to impress.  Had previously enjoyed Emirates design and layout of the A380 but having flown recently, it seems they've tried to save up on costs with reduced spacing between seats with thinner cushions.  Emirates staffs feel more likes nannies than polished butlers. Although they speak more than a dozen languages and look fashionably tailored, that's where it ends. An economy return ticket from Dubai to London was priced at a whopping 1200 GBP when other airlines were much cheaper. The only advantage I saw in paying so much was that it was a direct flight and I didn't have any lengthy layovers.  One would expect that after having checked in online a baggage drop would be quite a simple task and hardly time consuming. However, it seemed like the baggage drop lines were bigger than regular Check in queues and I don't really find much of a differences in what the staff were doing in the check in counters and baggage drop counters. Overall, I am quite disappointed with Emirates and next time I fly this sector, I might seriously consider other airlines.",5,2016-09-19,United Arab Emirates,False,review emirate lost edge series unnecessary change last year traveling first world destination emirate provide latest aircraft state art feature polished service however take flight developed destination better flying one budget airline sector much difference service whole lot gain price flying london heathrow would expect best unfortunately failed impress previously enjoyed emirate design layout flown recently seems tried save cost reduced spacing seat thinner cushion emirate staff feel like nanny polished butler although speak dozen language look fashionably tailored end economy return ticket dubai london priced whopping gbp airline much cheaper advantage saw paying much direct flight lengthy layover one would expect checked online baggage drop would quite simple task hardly time consuming however seemed like baggage drop line bigger regular check queue really find much difference staff check counter baggage drop counter overall quite disappointed emirate next time fly sector might seriously consider airline

"✅ Verified Review | Milan to New York and Rome to Bangkok via Dubai. I've been flying with Emirates for the last 3 years during holidays. I have flown several times both in Economy and Business Class. I have flown in Business Class both on the Airbus A380-800 and the Boeing 777-300ER. Business Class is way better on the A380-800, where you get a lot of privacy (specially in windows seats), great food and a great service. Business Class is good enough in the 777-300ER, but you don't get a lot of privacy and the seats are angled lie-flat, so not as comfortable. Emirates Economy Class, specially on board of the A380-800, is one of the best in the world. I have flown for years with Lufthansa in Economy Class, and Emirates beats it hands down. The PTV screens are huge, there is a good amount of space, the plane is really quiet, and the service is better than on Lufthansa. What I mostly liked about Economy Class, apart from the IFE is the fact that they don't bring your food in hot aluminium trays, but in hard plastic, that is much better looking.

"For my first flight on Emirates, it was fabulous. Even though the flight left at 2.40am (which meant we had to sit around in Melbourne Airport for 7 hours, as we arrived from Wellington), the crew made it bearable. They were attentive, friendly and helpful. The flight was operated by a newish 777-300ER (A6-ENG) which was great. The ICE system was faultless, which on top of the generous size of the screens made the flight fly by. The seat size is a problem however, the 3-4-3 configuration is just mean. But the foot room was better than any other economy class. The food on-board was very average for Economy, as a small snack was provided after take-off and then before landing a large Breakfast was served. I also really liked the fact that the crew handed out hot towels and face wipes before takeoff and before landing. An added bonus was the great (but understandably slow) Wi-Fi, a first for me on a plane.

"✅ Verified Review |  Upgraded to First private suites on Brussels to Dubai using 777-300ER. A very agreable flight of course, but with a long series of problems that should not occur. After take-off, the seat could only operated through the large TV touch screen, not through the remotes, which is a bit painful as the creen is about 1m from the seat. This was fixed after 15 min. Then the TV screen started going black for 30sec every 10min while the soundtrack of the movie still played. The system was reset and then worked fine. Although only 3 people travelling in the First class cabin, crew brought a wrong entree, and insisted it was the right one even it was obviously not the case. After 10 min they apologized, and offered to cook the right one but this took another 30 min. Halfway through the flight the seat completely jammed, but I could easily pick another one as the cabin was less than half full. I must say Emirates' first class seat is in fact worse than their lie flat business class seats on the A380s.

Which I could not, so I asked for another car and driver, and left the car. But the organizers of the service on the pavement insisted I wait until they explained the route to follow to the driver.

I waited over 15 minutes to use a toilet in business and then one of the hostesses came out with her makeup bag (there was a line for both toilets).

"✅ Verified Review |  Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur. I was disappointed the staff were not friendlier during check-in. One of the best business class lounges, food, alcohol and facilities are great. Staff are the same as every other lounge. Service In Flight: The first time in my experience of flying business class that I was not greeted with a welcome drink, while other people in the cabin received it. I had a feeling of unwelcomeness from the staff - an overall indifference.  The only thing premium is the menu and not necessarily the service. I think the diversity of their crew is the biggest problem. There is no cohesive identity and embedded culture of service and welcoming.  Even having to press the call button twice on a few occasions to receive service. Food quality varied - some were delicious, the others not. Seating was very uncomfortable.

"✅ Verified Review | Birmingham to Colombo via Dubai with Emirates. Poor throughout, specially onboard food and service which is what I thought Emirates was renowned for and worth paying extra for. Birmingham to Dubai we had the A380 which was very comfortable with seats that I could sit cross-legged on. The entertaintment system was also amazing. This is where the positives end as the boarding of this flight took so long that there was an hour delay to take off. The organisation for transfers was poor to non-existent with a massive queue for security at Dubai with minimal time for the connection. For the rest of our flights, Dubai to Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka to Dubai with a stop at Male and Dubai to Birmingham, we had the smaller and older aircraft B777-300. This was noticably older, dated and uncomfortably cramped. The entertainment screens poor quality in comparison. The worst of all was the inflight service. Pressed my buzzer for help with a non-functioning screen and an hour later, nobody had come to ask what I needed. In the end, I had to keep pressing the buzzer continuously about 15 times before someone came to us. I had no entertainment for the duration of 2.5 hours. It only took 5 minutes to fix when they actually got round to it. The food and beverage service also poor. They had a choice of fish or chicken but by the time they got to aisle 23, they had completely run out of chicken. I offered to wait till the end of service to see if any was left. I was told categorically there was none left and then later I saw them handing chicken to some passengers. On the 8-hour flight from Dubai to Birmingham, after an hour on the plane before take off and an hour on the bus waiting to board the plane, apart from the little tub of water with the snack and breakfast, no drinks runs to even offer people water. On walking around, I saw all the service staff at the back of the plane with tea and biscuits having a good old jolly.

"Milan Malpensa to New York JFK with Emirates. The A380 is a beautiful plane, and the version that Emirates has outfitted is a little to flashy for my taste, fake wood and gold trim. The seats are great, lie flat with direct aisle access, the ICE inflight entertainment has a mind boggling array of movies and shows from every corner of the planet. Comfort of the bed was OK, a little more padding would be nice. They provide you with a mattress and blanket, which helps. Seat 14K has direct window access with storage against the wall which was great. Boarding directly from the lounge at Malpensa was really nice, I love the inflight bar in the back. The food was good, not great, I've had just as good food on domestic USA first class, although not as plentiful as I received on Emirates. A couple of glitches. The FA's completely forgot to serve me my main course, I had to ask after everyone was served. Very apologetic and kind apology from the FA. Next I wasn't served my dessert, I was dozing, that was OK. However I was offered a choice of desserts and the wrong one was brought to me. I expected a little more polish.

"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires with Emirates. At Rio International Airport Emirates use the Gol Lounge. This is a simple lounge with no frills. The food and drinks were poor and the seating not very good. The Emirates ground staff kept Business and First class passengers queuing at the boarding gate for some time while some ""priority"" economy passengers boarded - I have never seen this before. Even when allowed to board the problem was that economy passengers had to come through the Business Class cabin, so stowing hand luggage etc. became a problem as to do so meant blocking the aisles while these passengers were trying to get past. The aircraft had a very tired feel and look. The seat layout in the Business Class cabin was 2-3-2 which made leaving your seat if you were not on the aisle a problem. The cabin staff were good and efficient. The food was possibly the worst I have ever had on any Business Class flight. Although there was supposedly Wi-Fi available I was never able to connect to it. I didn't really use the in-flight entertainment much but it was a little awkward and fiddly with a strange ""tablet"" type control which didn't seem to control anything.",6,2016-08-24,Brazil,False,review flew rio de janeiro buenos aire emirate rio international airport emirate use gol lounge simple lounge frill food drink poor seating good emirate ground staff kept business first class passenger queuing boarding gate time priority economy passenger boarded never seen even allowed board problem economy passenger come business class cabin stowing hand luggage etc became problem meant blocking aisle passenger trying get past aircraft tired feel look seat layout business class cabin made leaving seat aisle problem cabin staff good efficient food possibly worst ever business class flight although supposedly wi fi available never able connect really use flight entertainment much little awkward fiddly strange tablet type control seem control anything
"✅ Verified Review |  Johannesburg to Hong Kong via Dubai. Our flight took off and about about 2 or 3 hours into the flight the captain of our flight announced that our flight had been turned back to Johannesburg due to a problem at Dubai airport. No further announcements were made. On arrival back in Johannesburg we disembarked the plane and waited approximately 2 hours to receive our luggage, after which we were ushered to a bus taking us to a hotel where we would spend the night. Bearing in mind that our hotel arrangements were in place when landed back in Johannesburg, this could have been communicated to passengers over the PA system or by Emirates ground crew. We were not given any update as to what would happen to our connections.  We were shuttled back to the airport at 2am, boarding commenced at 3am and we took off again at 5 am. At no point were we given any indication of what would happen to our connections. When we arrived in Dubai (around 3:30pm) we were greeted with the chaos that was Dubai Airport, and then spent 11 hours waiting to be assigned new connecting flights. I was eventually given a connecting flight to Hong Kong 2 days later and put on standby for a flight leaving 3am on 5 August.  Rudeness from Emirate ground staff, all we were given were muffins juice and water for sustenance. Not a single Emirates employee made an announcement to make sense of the chaos nor where there any notices or communications.

"London Heathrow to Dhaka via Dubai flying with Emirates in economy class. There was a long line at check in at LHR Terminal 3. Security was smooth, though. There are a range of big brand duty-free shops at T3 so that was a bonus. Then boarding came. In my personal opinion, Emirates should have extra boarding time for bigger planes like the A380s as the long line resulted in a delay of 1 hour. After boarding, I checked out our seats. The seats are comfortable with adequate leg-room. The IFE System was clearly bigger and better than the last time we flew with Emirates. The flight was smooth as usual with EK and the meal was very delicious with now more bigger portions. We safely landed at Dubai International Airport at Terminal 3. It was very hard, though to find out where flight connections were as two signs led to different places. The shops at Dubai were even better with more choices of retail. Soon after the short wait we boarded the Boeing 777-300ER from Dubai to Dhaka, in Bangladesh. The seating was mostly the same but had smaller IFE Systems like old Emirates and the touchscreen response was poorly. They managed to maintain the plane cleanliness quite well. The food was more than shocking on this one. Nevertheless we had another smooth flight to Dhaka. On both flights the cabin crew were outstanding and were kind and polite. At Dhaka our baggage took at least two hours to come even though in the domestic terminal we had another flight with a different airline 2 and a half hours after landing.

The car arrived at our Singapore lodgings in fine time, and we were soon on our way to Changi, where we arrived in time for a very fine breakfast in the First/Business Lounge. We were welcomed aboard our 777, with the usual courtesy, but my infotainment screen wouldn't work. Attempts to re-boot failed. Fortunately there were empty seats with working screens so I moved. All went well until the pilot announced we were about to commence our descent into Dubai. I switched to the 'flight details' on the screen of my 'new' seat. Without warning the 'destination' changed from 'Dubai' to 'Sharjah'. Ten minutes later the pilot announced that we would indeed be going to 'Sharjah', and another ten minutes later we indeed landed at Sharjah. Our 777 'parked' alongside several others, in a secluded corner of the airport. Hours passed. We weren't allowed to leave the plane. Information was hard to come by from the crew, but someone with contacts in Dubai learned on his mobile phone that there had been a serious incident at Dubai which closed the airport. Without warning buses arrived, and we were asked to board them. It looked like the bus depot rejects had been mobilised. We found ourselves in a minibus which had definitely seen better days. It did have air con but I made the mistake of sitting in the front over the engine, which gave out more heat than the air con gave cool. We set out, we knew not for where, in a convoy with police escort. After many stops and starts, we eventually arrived at what appeared to be the 'employees' entrance of Dubai airport. A man in white robes and a baseball cap then appeared to assume responsibility for our 'convoy'. With much gesticulating he seemed to instruct the drivers of the buses in our convoy to follow him. He drove an ordinary saloon car, with a yellow flashing light on top through a security gate, and our convoy of barely street legal buses followed him 'airside'. Eventually, driving by parked planes, and other 'airside' traffic, we came to an 'arrival gate', we were only too pleased to leave the oven-hot interior of the mini bus for the air conditioned splendour of the main terminal building at Dubai. Imagine our delight when we saw that the 15.00 hrs departure for Glasgow had not yet left. It was now about 19.30hrs. The 'departures screen' announced 'Gate Open', so we made our way there and checked in. The Emirates staff in attendance couldn't tell us when the delayed flight might actually depart, but they did advise that we should stand by. Eventually the flight was boarded, and took off at about 21.30hrs. Six and a half hours late. The flight was incident free, although again I couldn't make the 'infotainment' system work, and we landed at Glasgow at 01.45hrs on Thursday 4th August 2016, just under six hours behind schedule. Our bags of course were still in the Middle East, so carrying practically nothing we went to get our chauffeur car home. The final indignity. They had given 'our' car to someone in greater need, we would have to make do with a complimentary local taxi. So ever so jet lagged, a taxi, nearly as grotty as the Sharjah mini bus, but not so hot, delivered us home in the wee small hours of the morning. Actually less than six hours behind schedule was so much better than I feared when we first diverted to Sharjah. We were reunited with our luggage during the evening of Friday 5th August, when a driver brought them to our home.

Our flight to Boston was pretty good, except that my seat and my cousin's seat cannot be reclined, so we weren't able to sleep well, it was very uncomfortable. I think they should do something about it knowing that long haul flights are very tiring. Now, our flight back from JFK int'l airport to Manila, is very much a hassle . We were only told that the flight was delayed for 5 hours exactly during check in time (instead of 11:20am, it became 4:30 in the afternoon) which obviously made us upset plus the fact that nobody is explaining why it was delayed. It's a good thing though that they already allowed us to check in our luggage. However we needed to line up at the Check-in counter for an hour and 30 minutes. It was also disappointing that when waiting on the line, almost all the counters prioritized the Business class passengers. The flight however had a late boarding, it was supposed to board at 3:30 but they started boarding at 4:30. Our co-passengers have become impatient. We all crowded the boarding gate. Why? No one announced what's happening. I asked the ground personnel, what time are they boarding but her answer is just ""in a few minutes"".

Travelling alone so I requested that they serve my food later as my baby was asleep on my lap but they declined due to policy. Suggested to put my food tray on the floor which is ridiculous.

"✅ Verified Review |  Perth to Dubai. I booked my ticket through Qantas for a route serviced by Emirates. At the check in, Emirates staff was not able to locate me in their system. Instead of clearing the issue with Qantas themselves, I had to go and talk to Qantas and forward Qantas message to Emirates, because according to Emirates (expressed in pretty arrogant way) I booked the ticket with Qantas and thus it is up to me to clear it. For me as a customer it does not make sense, as I would expect the airline to clear the issues they have with their internal systems themselves and not make the customer to try and resolve it at the airport, a couple of hours before the departure. Once the issue was resolved, the seat I originally booked, was also changed (from aisle to the window). Of course it is a small thing, but in the circumstances, it was annoying, as I particularly booked a seat at the aisle feeling unwell before the trip.",4,2016-08-06,Australia,False,review perth dubai booked ticket qantas route serviced emirate check emirate staff able locate system instead clearing issue qantas go talk qantas forward qantas message emirate according emirate expressed pretty arrogant way booked ticket qantas thus clear customer make sense would expect airline clear issue internal system make customer try resolve airport couple hour departure issue resolved seat originally booked also changed aisle window course small thing circumstance annoying particularly booked seat aisle feeling unwell trip

"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Kolkata via Dubai, with a stopover of around 1 hr 30 mins in Dubai. Mobile boarding pass for both legs issued at the time of on line check in. Only reaching Gatwick at the time of depositing my check-in luggage I was told due to bad weather at Dubai, the incoming flight was delayed, consequently the flight from Gatwick will be delayed by 1 hour, meaning I will not be able to travel on my scheduled flight from Dubai to Kolkata - but have been rebooked on the next flight departing Dubai more than 12 hours later. There were at least 1 flight from Gatwick, and 2 flights from Heathrow that departed earlier than the 13:35 flight I was travelling, and if I was put on any of these flight I could have comfortably connected to my original DXB-Kolkata flight. Despite 1 hour delay in LGW-DXB flight, there was still 30 mins before my original DXB-CCU flight was due to depart, and I offered to travel on my original flight with my hand luggage only – the checked in luggage can arrive in a later flight, and I can return to the Kolkata airport to collect my checked in luggage. I was only told everything is being done as per Airlines policies. (One of the ground staff started choreographing what fog looks like and why it is difficult for a pilot to fly through fog). Flight EK016 arrived in DXB around 1:25am, but I had to ask 4 different airline staff before gaining an understanding that I need to contact the transfer desk. It took me 17 mins in the queue at the transfer desk before I could reach the front, by which time the connecting Kolkata flight (departinf 02:00 hrs) was gone. I even proposed that I be allowed to travel to any other city e.g. Mumbai or Delhi, and be given a ticket on any domestic airlines from Mumbai/Delhi to Kolkata (or cash instead), but was told this was not possible. My only option is to travel by the later flight departing around 12 hrs later. So I had to hang around for the next 12 hours at the Dubai airport. My London to Gatwick flight was protected by EU Regulations, but the connecting flight from Dubai to Kolkata was not, despite travelling on the same ticket so I could not claim compensation under EU Regulations.

"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Tokyo Narita. During the flight, I wanted to buy some duty free products. I asked three times, and each time the cabin attendant told me that the person dealing with duty free goods would come along shortly, but never did. After the third attempt, I gave up. What annoyed me more was that the breakfast service was cancelled due to turbulence, after the special meals were already handed out during the same turbulence! I had recently experienced more severe turbulence over the Atlantic, and the in flight service was not cancelled on that occasion (different airline). So I had to look on enviously at some of my fellow passengers while my own stomach was grumbling. In the end, I arrived in Tokyo after a 9 hour flight extremely hungry and with a back ache (seats seemed to be made of cardboard). The only positive thing about the flight was the in flight entertainment, which included wifi and live tv. That, however, is not enough to convince me to fly on Emirates with my own money again, particularly as I paid a 25% premium to fly on Emirates this time.

Unfortunately this proved to not be my experience. When you fly long haul as often as I do the one thing that really matters is the seat - that's what I'm paying for. I don't believe I have experienced a more uncomfortable seat ever. Not flatbed but angled - no comfort in any position left me arriving with back pain and exhausted by lack of sleep.

This was a long flight, with a 3 hour leg to Rio, a transit stop and then a 14 hour haul from Rio to Dubai. I was the only passenger in First on the initial sector, and there were 2 of us on the second. Service was exemplary - warm, attentive and professional. The suite on the 777 is just as spacious as on the A380 and immaculately clean and shiny. As ever I enjoyed the mini bar, treat basket, beautiful amenity kit, writing set, and wonderfully soft pyjamas and slippers. I was able to get a great sleep. Food and beverage quality and quantity, as ever on Emirates, was First Class. Dom Perignon champagne, vintage fine wines, 40 year old port, ultra premium cognac. Wifi worked well and was available throughout the flight for just $1, not the rip-off charges on some competitors (Etihad and Qatar for example) We arrived early, luggage delivery was super fast and I was soon in my Mercedes limo and being whisked home.

"✅ Verified Review |  Manchester to Dubai in Business Class. An excellent experience from start to finish. Chauffeur drive pick up worked perfectly and check in was very quick. I was seated in my pre-booked aisle seat in the 777-300ER which serves the morning flight from Manchester (the other 2 flights are operated by an A380). Fast track security worked like a dream. Within 10 minutes of arriving at the airport I was seated in Emirates' excellent lounge enjoying an outstanding breakfast, as good as you will experience in the best 5 star hotels: cut fresh fruits, eggs benedict, stuffed field mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, warm bread and croissants. There were a selection of freshly squeezed juices and smoothies, but I opted for a glass of Veuve Cliquot champagne. Boarding was on time and we were soon seated with a friendly welcome and another glass of champagne. The business seat on the 777 is a little narrower than on the A380, but still very comfortable and it reclines to a lie flat bed, with nice new design duvet. Service throughout the flight was perfect with very good crew visibility and a purser who really was outstanding and lead by example. We enjoyed drinks and nuts (Emirates makes a very good Mojito), then a 5 course lunch, with light bites or afternoon tea served before landing. The inflight entertainment is of course very good, although unfortunately there was no WIFI or live TV on this 777. We arrived on time and were soon disembarked.

"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Manchester. Specifically chose this flight so that we could travel on the A380. Very disappointed. Boarding was OK and we were in seats 12E/F. Seats were a little narrow and widthways was restricted, nowhere to rest your elbows unless you used the bulkheads on either side, The floor ahead of the seat had a ridge in it which made it uncomfortable to stretch your legs out. Plane was 30 minutes late leaving due to one runway being out of use. Cabin service was very poor and disjointed. Starters were served and the mains did not arrive for twenty minutes. We were not offered tea or coffee after the meal and had to ask twice for it to be served, I gave up in the end. Times must be hard on Emirates; only one chocolate between us! The bar area at the rear of business cabin is the place to go if you want a drink, at least you get one there eventually. The pilot managed to make up the lost time and arrived in Manchester bang on time. Much prefer the A340 or Boeing 777 to this plane.

Then they put me on a Dubai-London flight. When asked why this is the case, they tell me that I will fly to London and then wait for another transfer to get on Washington DC flight. Already exhausted finding our bags then moving the bags with us to a different airport and then waiting 8 hours, I told them I just want to wait for the next direct flight to Washington. They tell me I need to talk to the guys in Dubai for they can't do anything. But then upon checking, I find that I have an hour or so to move to the transit gate. At this time, I have no idea when I will arrive in London or Washington. I am now sitting at the Dubai airport to find out that I will have to wait another 4 hours in London. And they are announcing the flight to London need to be boarded. Since my luggage is already tagged through these stops, I am waiting at the gate. But I have to say this is horrible.

"Difficult to fault, although I felt the cabin crew on the Delhi - Dubai (777-300ER) flight had an edge to them, attentive as soon as you board, called you by your name, introduce themselves and have a chat. Very welcoming. The upper deck of the A380 has so many cabin crew, they say hello as your go to your seat but then stand around for a long time before fully engaging, they seem to engage with each other more than the passengers. This is only an observation, but I have noticed it on a previous flight as well. Catering was very good from Delhi - Dubai, very good Indian meal, and Arab Mezze, lots of drinks offered and a beautiful Mango Mousse for desert. Cannot fault ICE the Emirates in flight entertainment system, its got an absolutely monster choice of movies / albums, more than enough, it took me ages to choose my movie as the selection was so good. Catering from Dubai to London, was OK, some sandwiches after take off which was early morning, were not particularly fresh, where as if you go back to the bar area the food there looked a lot more enticing (and fresh). I asked to borrow a pen, 5 times from the cabin crew to fill out my breakfast form, eventually had to go back to the bar to borrow one from the bar tender. Breakfast was good, and served just before landing at Gatwick. The A380 is a beautiful aircraft and just seems to float, little turbulence was felt, and the cabin / seats were superb. Strangely given the choice I would take the Boeing 777-300ER purely because the crew seem to be more on the ball, but overall the Emirates experience was very very good. Landing at Gatwick means quite a walk over the large bridge to get to the main terminal, assume due to the assigned parking areas for the A380. Bag was lost on arrival, no fault of Emirates, someone walked off with it by mistake, but Emirates were very helpful contacting the passenger who was on the M25 and had to bring my bag back - unbelievable.",10,2016-07-12,United Kingdom,False,difficult fault although felt cabin crew delhi dubai er flight edge attentive soon board called name introduce chat welcoming upper deck many cabin crew say hello go seat stand around long time fully engaging seem engage passenger observation noticed previous flight well catering good delhi dubai good indian meal arab mezze lot drink offered beautiful mango mousse desert cannot fault ice emirate flight entertainment system got absolutely monster choice movie album enough took age choose movie selection good catering dubai london ok sandwich take early morning particularly fresh go back bar area food looked lot enticing fresh asked borrow pen time cabin crew fill breakfast form eventually go back bar borrow one bar tender breakfast good served landing gatwick beautiful aircraft seems float little turbulence felt cabin seat superb strangely given choice would take boeing er purely crew seem ball overall emirate experience good landing gatwick mean quite walk large bridge get main terminal assume due assigned parking area bag lost arrival fault emirate someone walked mistake emirate helpful contacting passenger bring bag back unbelievable

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Denpasar via Dubai. We won't be choosing Emirates again. This was our first business class trip with Emirates rather than Qatar Airways, who we normally choose. A catalogue of problems, beginning with the chauffeur being an hour late to collect us, leaving us with a really stressful Friday afternoon journey around the M25 to cope with. We made it, but not by much. Seats on the A380 are great, but we were prevented from using toilets closest to us (reserved for 1st class we found out) and having to go to the back of the Business cabin to use an inadequate number of dirty toilets for what turns out to be a huge cabin. Food was mediocre; dried out (overheated) bread rolls and over-cooked dinners for both my husband and I. Staff are super though, that's their strength for sure. Arrived DXB, long bus ride to terminal (almost 15 minutes), very long walk and another change of terminals to find the next gate. Boeing 777 was really outdated; if you are not travelling with a partner, get ready for a stranger to climb over your not-very-flat bed to reach the aisle. Not acceptable in today's business class choices. TV screens are huge but the pixels make for grainy viewing and both my husband and I experienced our screens reverting to a puff-piece on Dubai and Emirates quite a few times when we were enjoying a movie. We could not connect to onboard wifi. Emirates lounge in DXB over-crowded with totally inadequate, smelly toilet facilities and queues at all times in both the men's and ladies loos. Emirates were cheaper than Qatar Airways but the choice for us will be to spend more to achieve the really high standard of care Qatar gets right.

✅ Verified Review |  My first time flying Emirates Business on A380 from Dubai to Manchester. I was impressed from the start. Went up to the business lounge - lots of comfortable seating and delicious food and drink available. Went straight to airplane from lounge. My seat was at the back of the section. There was a male passenger in the seat over the aisle and I must admit I felt very exposed and too close to him. Luckily there were several empty seats so I moved to a window seat - this time seat over aisle was unoccupied. Seat was very easy to move and very comfortable. Later I was offered a mattress but didn't need it. Staff very pleasant and helpful although during the flight I did ask for a drink of hot water which I never received. Meal served on white cloth. China by Royal Doulton. It felt lovely to drink out of a porcelain mug. Food was ok - better than Economy of course. I was able to have my choice but I think I chose wrongly. Later I had afternoon tea - bread had dried out but fillings very pleasant - much better than economy's which are sometimes inedible. Nice big screen to watch. I visited the bar area which was fun.

When departure is delayed by more than 45min it is not possible to catch-up during the flight as the sector is not long enough. Turnaround time in Amsterdam is very short, and thus departure time suffers quickly when the inbound flight is delayed.

"Flew London Heathrow to Dubai. Outstanding. Comments apply both ways. First time on an A380 and also first in Emirates business class. Normally fly with BA but for various reasons decided to give Emirates a go and very glad I did. Speedy check-in and straight into a very quiet and large lounge at LHR T3 with excellent food and beverage. Boarding straight from lounge onto top deck of A380. Had 3 aisle seats for the family, noticeable that Emirates have narrowed the aisle to allow for the wider seating arrangements. Very nice to have a near private seat and no neighbour, nice touch having the soft drink mini bar at each seat, and lots of good accessible storage. Seat took a little getting used to, I prefer being able to put my feet on the floor rather than on a foot rest and when lying flat out the shape of the seat in front encroaches where your legs go so means for taller people you have to adjust your position in the seat to be comfortable. The food was excellent, best I have had on board in 20 plus years and the crew were friendly and worked hard (I had slight concerns before flying as reputation is Emirates can be a bit hit and miss). Nice touch was the barman taking souvenir photos on request for passengers at the bar in an old style 60s technology Polaroid type camera - quite exciting for my daughter seeing a picture appear. And yes, being able to walk down to the bar makes for a good experience. Entertainment system and screen excellent. Phone can be used, wifi slow but ok for basic browsing. Large accessible toilets that were kept spotless for the entire flight. Fast tracked though immigration and priority luggage turned up first and escorted straight to the waiting limo.

"Barcelona to Sydney via Dubai with Emirates. The A380 in economy is roomy enough but service was again found wanting after meal service. Dubai won't allow liquids of more than 100ml past the boarding gate area so you rely on being provided enough water inflight. This I found near impossible and with my annoying dry cough I needed the liquid. I tried repeatedly to hail a passing staff member only to be ignored. Never before have I pressed the assistance button but when a staff member finally responded it was with an impatient look but she eventually brought a mouthful of water in a plastic cup. Hardly enough to keep well hydrated. When disembarking I spotted a water fountain with cups down the front end of economy I could have used, had I been able to get past the two large men sound asleep beside me - the perils of the window seat.

"Manchester to Dubai with Emirates. It was disappointing - paid to upgrade to business class and maybe expected too much. After queuing for check in we were immediately welcomed by the staff saying ""You are on a saver business ticket so you can't use the lounge"". Yes we knew that, but thankyou for making us feel so welcome. Onboard we settled into row 18 in the lovely A380 seats. The cabin supervisor was coming through welcoming people onboard - she clearly missed us out and carried on. No smile or hello. We hadn't paid enough, obviously. Next my husbands seat did not recline or indeed move. The centre partition was jammed half way down. The cabin supervisor came over and shrugged. We will reset the seat and see what happens - it got stuck half way to lie flat. We changed seats off our own back but the only seats available together were in row 26 infront of the rowdy men's pub area (inflight bar). If you want a peaceful flight don't sit in the rear section. It's like lying down at a party. The food service started - they took our orders early on but oh dear, our choices weren't available. No apology even though they would have known that already at time of taking the order. The food we got was lovely but really - back row problem in any class obviously. After being at the party a while, listening to some loud stories and eating something we didn't really want we found yet 2 more individual seats further down the cabin to try and sleep. It was shoddy the whole trip. Downstairs it was half full and people no doubt had 3 seats each anyway. We upgraded not for the food but to lie down and be more comfortable.

Completely oversold their family friendly service. It was a guessing game as to what we had to do with the stroller for our 7 month old. Although the kids meals were given as they had been pre-ordered I don't think they were particularly great quality. In terms of the cabin crew - rude, unfriendly and I could go on. We were issued the wrong menu - no apology. I asked for a glass of water for my little girl and it was as if I'd asked for gold. The serving of the food and drinks was very disjointed - no system, no organisation. I wasn't offered food twice as they bypassed me. My partner was missed out on a few occasions too. No apology. They didn't bother with the kids, I went to change the baby and when I was returning to my seat I had to wait in the aisle for 5 mins for them to move out of the way. They are clearly more important than you. The toilets were not maintained.

"EK208 from New York JFK to Dubai on May 18. Check-in lines were slow and the agent that checked us in acted like he wanted to be anywhere but there. Boarding was late and done by Zone numbers on boarding passes. The agents were strict about it and I like that - board when it's your zone and not just push and shove. Friendly flight attendants throughout the flight except one attendant who was stoic and robotic. All the others were smiles and happy to get water or snacks. Smooth take off and delicious meal (and plenty of it) was served within 90 minutes of take off. Tons of movie/TV options on ICE - but wifi wasn't working. No big deal but Emirates touts it so much it was a bit of a bummer. Screaming kids throughout the flight - not EK fault but they put the families with children in the first 2 sections of economy so if you want quiet sit in the last 2 sections. Pizza snack provided mid-flight, and in the galley fresh fruit, drinks and snacks available throughout flight. Landing in Dubai around 1pm they provided a breakfast which was good but better if it had been a lunch due to the time. One thing - the seat is ok at first but after 10 hours your bottom will be sore. Bring your own pillow or cushion and save yourself some pain. Smooth landing and short taxi to Terminal 3, but sat on the plane an extra 20 minutes as gate agents had some issue with electrical connection to the plane for the APU. Off the plane and quickly through immigration, but bags took a bit of time coming.

"Barcelona to Dubai with Emirates. Barcelona is one of the most passenger friendly airports we have ever flown through. From arrival to departure everthing to negotiate is very easy and it is for sure one of most favourite airports. However, the business class lounge is really in the dark ages. The food offering is really just appalling. Yesterday, there were 3 bowls of crisps, tortillas chips and bread bits. Sandwiches which had no butter, and just a piece of meat shoved in between. On another tray with a sign that says no pork, there is another tray of small rolls with cheese and stuff etc. It was lunch time when we went in and I was hungry having had a 4 hour journey to get to the airport. A tray of danish pasties appeared from the kitchen, at lunch time. On another counter there were plastic bowls of pasta salad. Just pasta with a dollop of cesar dressing. Getting on wifi is a huge mission. This is not in anyway shape or form Emirates standard of lounge and really needs to be addressed.

It ends up with the second line of means not being served consistently like the first. That is wine not served till food is done, etc. This actually needs managing and maybe a different approach.

"✅ Verified Review |  Travelled last month to Mauritius via Dubai from Manchester and returned back a few days ago. The flights were comfortable in general. Service was good, though some of the cabin crew appeared tired and not happy when requests were made. The A380 is a great aircraft and the journeys made did other make me tired. Food was OK, though concerned that the quality has somewhat changed as opposed to previous flights with the airline. Some meals were nice, though could have been better in some aspects. The WiFi service is ad-hoc and did not always work properly. This could be explained by virtue of the fact that there are Internet restrictions when flying over certain countries.

Dubai to Lisbon with Emirates. The B777-300 looked a bit tired compared to the B777-300ER, seat pitch seemed tighter, the entertainment screen was cracked and did not fully respond, the headsets were awful - seeming to increase engine noise and necessitating deafening volume to hear anything on screen. The seat cushion was a bit lacking in padding. Wine arrived early but from about climb out and for nearly 3 hours we experienced severe turbulence and in spite of regular calls for seat belts to be fastened and even the crew having to return to their seats for lengthy periods the service was somehow maintained. Dinner this time was king prawns with rice and greens in sweet chile sauce and better than we have often had in business class. The approach to Lisbon was equally bumpy but finishing with an excellent smooth landing about 20 minutes late. When I complimented the purser on the staff performance she invited me to their area at the rear to repeat my comments ""because I want them all to hear your compliments"" and gave me a couple of Drambuies to take home as a souvenir.

Flew Emirates from Lisbon to Dubai. Full flight on fairly new aircraft with adequate pitch although a bit narrow. Take off and landing on time although parked away from the terminal at Dubai. The cabin crew were excellent - smart and friendly as always - to the extent that, knowing the habit of serving drinks after the food, I asked for a wine when getting seated and it was brought even before we were at cruising height. The seafood meal of chargrilled salmon was delicious and accompanied by yet another wine. After dinner coffee was accompanied by a wide range of liqueurs. Cabin staff were regularly coming through the cabin to offer drinks and to check after passenger comfort and finished with ice-cream about an hour before landing. The other thing to mention is the 'assisted passenger service' which was superb at both ends with a helper staying with you from check-in to the aircraft door and again from aircraft door to pick-up transport and then actually refusing a tip.",9,2016-05-10,Portugal,False,review flew emirate lisbon dubai full flight fairly new aircraft adequate pitch although bit narrow take landing time although parked away terminal dubai cabin crew excellent smart friendly always extent knowing habit serving drink food asked wine getting seated brought even cruising height seafood meal chargrilled salmon delicious accompanied yet another wine dinner coffee accompanied wide range liqueur cabin staff regularly coming cabin offer drink check passenger comfort finished ice cream hour landing thing mention assisted passenger service superb end helper staying check aircraft door aircraft door pick transport actually refusing tip
"✅ Verified Review |  I was flying Emirates from Muscat to New York via Dubai, with a friend who has an Arabic last name. During boarding we were called aside at the boarding counter as his name had to undergo an additional security clearance. We were the first ones to commence the boarding procedure, but after 2 hours of waiting they still had not resolved the issue. They told us the visa was OK, and that it was some kind of issue in the Emirates systems. We were not told exactly what the issue was, all we could see was that the boarding desk in Dubai was arguing with the Emirates office in JFK for the boarding release. The debate affected three travelling parties. Despite the flight already being 45 minutes delayed the JFK office refused to support the Dubai ground staff in clearing the passengers, but instead opted to open a roughly half-hour general debate with the Dubai desk on how to use the system and on the trainings they needed. This debate was held on loud-speaker. Long story, short: In the end I was told to board the plane alone or lose my flight while my friend was offloaded to take a following flight. (Curiously enough 5 minutes after Emirates closed the flight my friend was cleared, but by then it was too late to get aboard). I ended up waiting for him half a day at JFK. I found the whole incident to be quite unprofessional, and I believe the airline ground staff (especially in JFK) should collaborate more in the interest of the customer rather than power playing games with each other. This is the third incident I had with Emirates (I was once told to choose another carrier if I didn’t like flying with Emirates after they kept delaying my flights for 2 working days).",9,2016-05-10,Oman,False,review flying emirate muscat new york via dubai friend arabic last name boarding called aside boarding counter name undergo additional security clearance first one commence boarding procedure hour waiting still resolved issue told u visa ok kind issue emirate system told exactly issue could see boarding desk dubai arguing emirate office jfk boarding release debate affected three travelling party despite flight already minute delayed jfk office refused support dubai ground staff clearing passenger instead opted open roughly half hour general debate dubai desk use system training needed debate held loud speaker long story short end told board plane alone lose flight friend offloaded take following flight curiously enough minute emirate closed flight friend cleared late get aboard ended waiting half day jfk found whole incident quite unprofessional believe airline ground staff especially jfk collaborate interest customer rather power playing game third incident emirate told choose another carrier like flying emirate kept delaying flight working day

The Boeing 777 seats are at a 15 degree angle so your legs can not be flat. This flight seemed understaffed. Too few bathrooms which were tiny and not always clean.

My trip to Bangkok and Hong Kong last week was a trauma, or a nightmare I can't get over, with them misplacing my luggage - on both flights - back to back and then in Bangkok it wasn't delivered until I had to leave the country, when I got it from their departure counter just in time to leave the country. In Hong Kong, they misplaced it (""erroneously"" according to the response of the customer service staff) only to have it delivered the next day to my hotel. Also, their customer service staff is irrational and do not respond in time to queries unless few email reminders are sent to them. I'd never recommend Hong Kong at all, since Emirates does not have a counter there to attend to baggage misplaced by them, it is outsourced to an agency (Jardine services) who don't speak English properly.

"✅ Verified Review |  Horrible airline that leaves customers stranded and out of pocket. My original flight was to depart 4th April from Tokyo Haneda to Brussels via Dubai. I had a connecting Eurostar booked from Brussels to London, which is my final destination. Due to the unfortunate events at Brussels, my flight from Dubai to Brussels was cancelled. However, I was informed (with a lousy text) less than 24hrs before the first leg to Dubai. I then had to contact customer service and spent hours trying to get my flight rerouted. 1st, they wouldn't take me to my final destination which was London, nor did they offer me a reroute to bring me back to Brussels to catch my Eurostar to London. They said my ticket could not be refunded due to ticket class (when they cancelled the flight) so I could not book another flight to get myself home to London. They said the only way I could go to London with Emirates was to top up EUR700, which is ridiculous. They told me to ring back every 2-3 hours to check if I got on a rerouted flight as all forwarding flights from Dubai were overbooked (I was in a completely different timezone, had to wake up every few hours, and less than 20 hours before my first leg was to depart) and they also emphasised that if I arrived in Dubai and was not confirmed on a connecting flight (I'll be in the air, so I wouldn't know till I landed), I will have to cover my own accomodation in Dubai till a connecting flight could be confirmed. Extremely frustrated with the situation, I told them to book me on the first confirmed flight that I could get all the way from Tokyo to Paris, which resulted in me being stranded in Tokyo for 2 additional days. I also had to pay for a new Eurostar ticket back to London as Emirates would not cover it. Adding a cherry to the cake, my luggage did not arrive with me in Paris (which I did attempt to check at Dubai that the luggage did make it to the connecting plane, and I was assured it did). After much arguing, Emirates baggage staff assured me that they will send the luggage to my forwarding address directly in London. Fast forward to 13th April, rang Emirates in the past few days only to find that they didn't know where my luggage was other than it was put on a flight to Heathrow on 8th April. Yesterday, the French office told me to call Heathrow myself to look for it. After arguing with them, they then contacted their UK team and located my bag at the airport. Emirates French office customer service then told me to go to Heathrow T5 Belt XX to collect my delayed luggage. I was infuriated and instead of offering to arrange delivery to me as they had promised on the 6th April, she offered me an email address to contact to try and 'convince them to send it to me'.

"✅ Verified Review |  After traveling on long distances routes with various carriers over the last 5 years I decided to go back and revisit Emirates in the A380 transiting in Dubai. I'm happy I did. Flew Hong Kong to Madrid via Dubai. Emirates seem much improved to me. The upper deck in the A380 is peerless, but there are a number of things that set Emirates apart now, in my opinion. The ground staff and transit interactions in Dubai, at least in Business, are just head and shoulders above anything else. The Business Departures is actually separate and you enter the plane directly from the lounge: stress-free, anyone? No lines, no hassle, no hysteria. The synergy is seamless. I love Cathay and Hong Kong, but they don't have that. JFK or Heathrow? Dream on. I recently had an appalling transit experience with Turkish in Istanbul and I would say this flight on Emirates showed how much more professional and logistically advanced Emirates are than that overrated carrier. Not to mention that the Dubai lounges are huge with great food and smiling staff. On board: again, top service, attentive and unfailingly good-humored. The walnut panelling is really nice, the cabins are soothing and elegant. The inflight screens are huge and crystal clear, wide selection of multi-lingual movies, including new releases from Korea and Japan. Food was superb, and I mean superb. For the first time in years I actually enjoyed the entire experience of a 14 hour flight. Moreover, they offer free limo service in every city you arrive in: they don't botch the reservations and the guys are waiting for you at the gate. What! Given that their prices are average, I would say Emirates now outclass almost every other long distance carrier if we except the Japanese, Korean Air, Singapore and Cathay, and maybe Quantas. But do any of these offer the add ons and extras that Emirates offer? I'll have to try a few of them in the near future.

"A real tale of two halves flying with Emirates. Boarding at Birmingham was fine. Seat pitch was ok for someone who is 6'6"". Food and entertainment both acceptable. However, the service on both this leg and the Dubai to Bangkok leg was sadly lacking. Pressing the call button usually resulted in a 10-15 minute wait. The same couldn't be said for the return legs 2 weeks late where the crew couldn't have been more attentive. Couple of points of note: The A380 is a wonderful aircraft. Spacious, bright, quiet and comfortable. If you are sat towards the front downstairs there is a slight lack of overhead locker space due to the way the aircraft tapers in. It is much quieter sitting at the front compared to elsewhere in the aircraft so do try and sit in the forward cabin. Boarding was hit and miss at both DXB and BKK. Some announcements were done via the tannoy and some by the ground crew shouting out instructions. From DXB to BKK, there was a drunken passenger who kept singing and waking passengers up. The crew kept coming to speak to him but then also kept bringing him drinks. The situation could have been handled better. Now that the A380 is flying into/out of BHX, will certainly look to book with Emirates again in the future",9,2016-04-09,United Kingdom,False,real tale two half flying emirate boarding birmingham fine seat pitch ok someone food entertainment acceptable however service leg dubai bangkok leg sadly lacking pressing call button usually resulted minute wait said return leg week late crew attentive couple point note wonderful aircraft spacious bright quiet comfortable sat towards front downstairs slight lack overhead locker space due way aircraft taper much quieter sitting front compared elsewhere aircraft try sit forward cabin boarding hit miss dxb bkk announcement done via tannoy ground crew shouting instruction dxb bkk drunken passenger kept singing waking passenger crew kept coming speak also kept bringing drink situation could handled better flying bhx certainly look book emirate futu
"✅ Verified Review |  I stepped onboard my Emirates flight from London Gatwick to Phuket via Dubai to that lovely aroma of business class. It's not a normal thing for me to travel in business class, but it isn't a distant dream anymore. The seats appealed to me, and I loved the layout. Once I had settled in, I spotted one flaw, which was the lack of storage everywhere, but the storage available just about accommodated all my items. Once we had taken off, I sat down to what I would have described as a 'bumpy flight' coming from a nervous flyer though. However, the wide selection of movies, space available for sleep and excellent dining occupied my thoughts to more important things. There are only a couple of words to describe this cabin - beautiful, elegant and stylish. The second flight had a more tranquil atmosphere in a smaller cabin with a different design, due to an older, smaller plane. The entertainment was a little disappointing, as the response for all the channels (which were very limited) was far from instant. The dining started and ended on a slightly different tone, it couldn't disappoint. Overall I strongly recommend Emirates.",5,2016-04-07,United Kingdom,False,review stepped onboard emirate flight london gatwick phuket via dubai lovely aroma business class normal thing travel business class distant dream anymore seat appealed loved layout settled spotted one flaw lack storage everywhere storage available accommodated item taken sat would described bumpy flight coming nervous flyer though however wide selection movie space available sleep excellent dining occupied thought important thing couple word describe cabin beautiful elegant stylish second flight tranquil atmosphere smaller cabin different design due older smaller plane entertainment little disappointing response channel limited far instant dining started ended slightly different tone disappoint overall strongly recommend emirate
"✅ Verified Review |  I chose Emirates for 3 reasons, ability to fly out of Boston, pricing, and desire to experience the A380 for the first time. I had flown EK once previously, a HKG-BKK one way several years ago. I was aware of their 4 star ranking and recalled from my previous trip that I felt that accurate. I am not sure that I would give them a solid 4 ranking based on these two flights. First, the good. Despite a miserable snowstorm in Boston we only had a brief delay in departure and made up time enroute. The flight only had 130 passengers so boarding was quick and easy. I would have thought that the high ratio of FAs to pax would have resulted in exemplary service. Not so. There was no drink service offered and an hour after takeoff, needing to take some medicine, I was finally able to flag down the Purser who promptly took care of me and checked back several times throughout the flight. Pity the rest of the crew were not so attentive. One appeared annoyed when I asked for another drink and pressing the call button was ignored. Though the bell sounded and the light went on, the FA told me it wasn't working when I walked back to the galley. The food at lunch suffered from the long delay in serving it. The chicken pesto sounded great but was too difficult to cut let alone chew. The bread (in cellophane) was cold. The flight itself was very smooth. Changing to the A380 in Dubai was trying due to the extreme heat and the mass of people. Once aboard I found that the seat I had selected from a seating chart was not where I expected it to be. Aisle seat next to the middle galley. I was banged into by FAs the entire flight, rarely with an apology. The service trolleys were continually blocking every aisle in every direction making a trip to the pitifully scare restrooms an ordeal. The food was better than the trip out. So good, in fact, that the FAs were continually eating. I have never seen so many FAs consuming food in plain view of pax. Again, smooth flights but service wise I would be hard pressed to give this a sold 4 star rating. No comparison to the level of service on Qatar, which thankfully had just begun service out of Boston.

I tried many times to check in and choose my seat but the system locked me out. When I made a phone call to Emirates they told me of their inability to do a thing about it. This resulted in being allocated a horrible seat in the middle, for the 13 hours long flight with the aisle person making it almost impossible for me to even go to the toilet. Topping it up the Emirates staff was unresponsive on the plane. When the staff was called they did not come even after pressing the tab 5 times. The entertainment system had so many glitches that I could hardly watch it. The worse thing was the bus from the plane to the terminal herding us like cattle.

They gave us a meal voucher and said that is the best they could do. The staff said because of immigration rules they cannot offer anything to passengers if it is less than 8 hours. There was no empathy and I do not blame the staff from connections to the lounges we spoke to, as they kept referring there are no managers on duty who are empowered to authorize a place to rest and this is standard policy for missed flights arising due to delays.

On the last flight out of Manchester that day I had dinner in the lounge prior to boarding and watched a movie on the 21"" screen during standing, taxi and take off before getting my bed made as soon as the seatbelt sign went out. I got about 5 hours of sleep before landing. The second leg in the 777-300 is very different. I sat in the aisle seat and my partner had the window. Unlike the A380 window and middle seats of the 2-3-2 layout need to clamber over the aisle seat to get in and out. Seats are comfortable but not full flat bed when reclined.

"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Dhaka via Dubai, returning to Newcastle via Dubai. London Heathrow to Dubai started off well as I only had hand luggage so getting to gate was a breeze thanks to Emirates easy and intuitive mobile check-in. It all went downhill from here though. On boarding was clear my ICE seat back screen was not working or responding. Worse it wouldn't switch off and kept flickering. I informed a member of the cabin crew about the issue but there wasn't a lot of enthusiasm or effort made to help. I asked if could be switched off if it could not be made to work, and never heard anything for the rest of the flight leaving me with flickering screen to contend with for 8 hours which was distracting and didn't really help me sleep on a night flight. I understand things go wrong and am reasonable but its how you handle things that matters. Once over Dubai, landing was delayed and we were put in holding pattern for 1.5 hours due to fog. We were informed that ground staff would be on hand to help those with missed connections and those that had tight ones to make and I was relieved at first to see a lot of staff about. However it seemed they were only helping certain people and when I asked, I got yelled at very disrespecftfully to go look at the departure board. I was left to fend for myself when I only had 20 minutes to get my gate for the flight to Dhaka which was showing as ""Final Call"". Infuriated and out of breath I arrived at the gate just in time to be met with a surly and unapologetic gate staff. I was then shoved on bus in the Dubai heat and we were left there for half an hour without any updates past take-off time. We were then bussed to the cargo terminal where our plane was parked and boarded and then left for a further 45 minutes without much information. The saving grace of the DXB-DAC sector was the crew were quite friendly and warm, and unusually the catering was rather nice. Returning DAC-DXB, even getting into the aiport was a nightmare due the corruption and difficulties that have returned with using Dhaka airport and the use of the local airlines Biman handling team is slow and innefficient. The hassling for money of my elderly mother from her requested assistance was also unwelcome. The flight itself DAC-DXB was uneventful, but the food was atrocious even by Emirates standards - almost inedible. Thas was repeated on the DXB-NCL sector as well. All in all very much going downhill, even the hard product is showing some weariness and there's complacency in improvements on these - the 10 abreast seating on Boeing 777's is horrific. Staff attitude has always been their weak point but it has got particularly bad to the point of contempt, especially when things go wrong.

My experience on the outbound flights was not good and unless something pretty good happens on the way back, I wouldn't recommend them or use them again. The positive was the entertainment system which was good quality and a good selection and check in was efficient and pleasant. Seats were uncomfortable (hard) and the seat on the second leg was broken so it wouldn't lock in recline mode (flight full, so no spares). The quality of the food was not good and out of the three meals over the journey, two of them had ran out of one of the two choices supposedly available, so locked into a dish I did not want. Whilst the crew were pleasant enough the service was really bare bones and seem to focus around the main meal times rather than between times. The second leg of the flight was extremely cold in the cabin and despite people raising it, it didn't improve. Blankets all round. Broadband was woeful despite paying for it and I gave up in the end.

"My Emirates route was Hamburg to Bangkok via Dubai, connecting to Yangon with Bangkok Airways. Hamburg to Dubai was delayed so I needed to rush to the other Gate which was unfortunately in another Terminal. From the stopover time of about 1.5 hrs I had left before boarding 20 mins. The rest of the time was the Bus from a parking position to the Gate, which took 25 mins. The flight from DBX to BKK was delayed as well, so again from around 1.5 hrs stop over was only 40 mins left until departure. There again I needed to run from the arrival gate to the departure gate, passing security once again, I made to be at the depature gate about 5 min before depature, luckily Bangkok Airways was waiting so I could take the flight. Arriving in Yangon, my luggage was lost in Bangkok due to the short stopover time. To get the paperwork done at the airport was a kind of journey, but it arrived in my hotel in the evening. The service on board is okay, nothing special. Mostly the staff was friendly and if you ask for drinks they will bring it to you. However it takes forever until they clean up the trays from the seat, which was not acceptable. Normally the stopover times were more then sufficient, however all of them ended up to be in a rush or to run through the airport to catch the next flight.

"Change of seat at the last minute due to a different 777-300ER configuration leading to be reallocated one of the worst set of seats in business class (seats 6A and 6B) from Dubai to Colombo. No contact made by Emirates on this change early enough to seek better seating. When loading with economy passengers my wife was continually bashed with their large walk-on luggage, she had to move to one side to avoid in being hit.

"I have been a long time fan of Emirates from the 90's, when they provided enough competition to make flying more humane from the antipodes. More recently though I have been less than satisfied with their service levels and customer service, this has accelerated since the ""merger"" of routes with Qantas. This flight was not so pleasant - the flight was delayed from Gatwick due to an oil spill and impacted the whole journey. The inflight service was generally good, food okay, the A380 seats are in the top quartile at the price point for comfort and pitch, I was comfortable on the A380 for the whole journey despite being a tall Aussie. I even snagged some good seats near the bulkhead which made legroom no problem. The 777 segment from Dubai to Melbourne (via Malaysia) was not pleasant. The planes are older, tired, have narrower seats and I was uncomfortable the whole journey. Try and avoid any Emirates segments that use this older equipment, it generally sours your experience of Emirates. The main problems I had with this journey was the late departure. The 4 hour delay caused me to miss my booked connection, and I was put onto the dog-leg segment via Malaysia. Emirates have refused any form of compensation in breach of European rules and refused to supply any assistance at the journey end for this delay. The obnoxious behaviour of customer service staff makes me rethink my loyalty to this brand.",5,2016-03-14,United Kingdom,False,long time fan emirate provided enough competition make flying humane antipode recently though le satisfied service level customer service accelerated since merger route qantas flight pleasant flight delayed gatwick due oil spill impacted whole journey inflight service generally good food okay seat top quartile price point comfort pitch comfortable whole journey despite tall aussie even snagged good seat near bulkhead made legroom problem segment dubai melbourne via malaysia pleasant plane older tired narrower seat uncomfortable whole journey try avoid emirate segment use older equipment generally sour experience emirate main problem journey late departure hour delay caused miss booked connection put onto dog leg segment via malaysia emirate refused form compensation breach european rule refused supply assistance journey end delay obnoxious behaviour customer service staff make rethink loyalty brand

"Flew Emirates business class from Birmingham to Bangkok via Dubai on 1 March, comfortable flight with no problems. However return journey on 9th was a completely different story. Total lack of customer care. I appreciate problems were caused by the storm in UAE, but this does not excuse Emirates of customer care. No information was supplied in Bangkok as to rescheduled flight and connections and therefore had 12 hour wait. Once on board flight the crew were indifferent and unhelpful. Arrived in Dubai and no help with connection flight. Went to business lounge and was told we had been downgraded to economy and we had 27 minutes to make the flight or would have to wait for 2 days for another flight.

"I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare.  The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome.  Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was there with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves.  Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes. I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again, different attendant but same story! I was forced to sit upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! Emirates boast about how many different countries the attendants come from.

Then the passenger and his wife left the plane. But the wrong luggage was taken from the plane, and another bag not belonging to anyone was shown by a steward to us all. None of the staff apologised for the delay or inconvenience. I arrived at Malpensa two hours late and very tired, having started my trip the day before in Yogyakarta.

"Chose Emirates as part of our package holiday to the Maldives. It was a bit of a mixed bag: I did my back in badly the day before the long flights. Walking/sitting was a real struggle. When we arrived at Heathrow we got a wheelchair and asked about an upgrade. I was not looking for it to be free but hoped a concession could be made. There was no movement however we were given a front seat in economy so I could move around as freely as possible. My discomfort was not a negative against the economy seats as ordinarily there would have been no issue. The A380 flight out I couldn't really settle in to. The food was excellent and immediate service good. The lead attendant saw the pain I was in and said if there was anything he could do just ask. I appreciate their ability to do anything to help me was extremely limited however because of my discomfort I couldn't enjoy the in-flight entertainment but again, not their fault. Transfers etc in Dubai went well. They appeared a bit chaotic but it seemed to be controlled chaos. Because of my condition we were shepherded to a holding area where I could be taken to the right gate at the right time. The 777 flight to Male I slept through as took a strong sedative to knock me out, however I did wake for breakfast which was again very good. By the time we flew back my back was feeling a bit better so I could appreciate the in-flight entertainment more and it really is excellent. A huge choice of music, films, tv shows to eat away the hours whilst flying. The A380 we had from Dubai to Heathrow was newer than on the way out and the tv screen in economy was about the size of an ordinary laptop screen, which I thought was excellent. It was touch-screen and again the food was excellent. My only negatives (discounting my bad back which obviously wasn't Emirates fault) were that I enquired about an upgrade to business class from Dubai to Heathrow. Quoted $5000 for 2 people, which I thought was ridiculous however we wanted to finish off the holiday in style so offered $4000. Didn't move. Would they rather not sell the seats and make the extra cash anyway? She told me that Dubai had the highest upgrade charge of any airport in the word. The flight back from Dubai to London, whilst more comfortable with excellent food and in-flight entertainment, we really felt like we were economy. You get what you pay for I suppose but having your (and your girlfriends) flight-attendant call button on for 20+ mins with no response and no-one going past is unacceptable. I only wanted a drink. In the end I gave up and waited for food to be served but in typical British fashion, didn't say anything. They bragged about having in-flight Wifi. I personally didn't try to connect but my girlfriend did and had zero joy. So, overall very good.

"Since we were traveling with golfbags I phoned Emirates in Amsterdam requesting for a Van or MPV to pick us up for our transfer to the airport. A few hours before pick up time we received a call confirming our request and indeed we were picked up by a van. Smooth check in, we could hand-over our golfbags to the groundstaff who delivered them to the special luggage desk. Emirates uses the Aspire lounge in Amsterdam which is hard to find due all ongoing renovation work in this airport. Boarding went OK in group, F and C passengers boarding straight to the upper deck. Arrival in Dubai in the B-concourse and we had to disembark via the forward stairs, making all Y passengers wait. Transfer was smooth, we used the Emirates longe in the C-concourse which was very crowded at that time of the day. In Mauritius the luggage was delivered using 2 belts, one for F/C and one for Y. Our luggage was delivered quickly, the golfbags were hand delivered from a different belt, again a very good service. Being seated in the middle (E/F paired) seats, both of us were served by different flight attendants.

"Flew with Emirates for the first time. JFK to Bangkok with layover in Dubai. I chose this flight due to short layover. All would be great if the flight was not delayed. We left JFK later than projected and ended up missing our flight from Dubai to Bangkok, resulting is a 8 hour layover. Emirates were not exactly sympathetic or apologetic and only after much fuss provided us with a few dollar worth food voucher (incorrectly printed for 3 passengers only rather than 4, which they were not happy to fix either). The flight was ok. A380 is an impressive plane. Seat are relatively comfortable in economy section, entertainment selection was very good. Food and drink service was ok. The crew was very international and not super friendly. Our seats were close to the galley and the staff not only left the curtain constantly opened, letting bright light in, they were also extremely loud, chit chatting, laughing. When I asked a flight attendant if she could close the curtain in order to reduce noise and make it darker so we could sleep she just walked away, returning in a few minutes with ear plugs, which I never requested. Eventually we ended up moving to the back of the plane (as flight was only half full) and had a peaceful reminder of the trip. Return flight from Bangkok to Dubai was also delayed. At some point there was airport security on board going through all carry-ons.  However afterwards the flight took off and was uneventful, with same okay food/drink service and not overly friendly the international crew.

"Our flights to and from Cape Town using Emirates for the first time were in the main very good for economy class. The 777-300 ER is a fine aircraft, but as a lot of reviewers have mentioned with Emirates having a 3-4-3 seating arrangement it does make it quite cramped, and being in an aisle seat I was constantly bumped into with people moving up and down the aisle. The crews on all our flights were very good, happy and willing to serve and help the passengers. The food for economy class was very good indeed, and the individual menu was a nice touch, and there were plenty of water and juice runs throughout the flights. Compared to other airlines I've flown with, Emirates don't have a general bar service before they serve their meals, although they do offer wine, water or juice with your meal, but right behind the meal service comes the bar service which just felt odd. The ICE entertainment system was excellent, large screens, huge selection of films, TV, and music to while away your flight, and the external cameras showed you views you normally don't get to see unless you are a pilot.

"Chauffeur pick up worked excellently, and is a really nice touch. The lounge at Birmingham was fairly small but large enough for the number of passengers and with good food and drink. The Birmingham to Dubai leg was on an old 777, and the 777 business product isn't as good as the product on other airlines for this length flight. The seats aren't fully flat nor do they have direct aisle access. As this was also an old plane the in flight entertainment was fairly poor. While the screen was enormous, the resolution was very low and the controls were frustratingly difficult. The cabin crew were fine without being outstandanding as was the food. The lounge at Dubai was very good as we were in a smaller one rather than the main central one. The food and drink offering was very good and I liked that some of the bar was self service. Dubai to Mumbai was on a newer 777 and the entertainment was much better. As this was a short flight through the night there is not too much to say, although the cabin crew were fairly good, they did insist on waking up passengers who had ordered food then clearly changed their mind and fallen asleep (it was 4am). Spending a long time trying to wake them up, not just a quick tap or hello. Arriving in Mumbai was fairly easy with prompt processing on the ground.

"Mumbai to Gatwick via Dubai with Emirates. Chauffeur pick up and check in/security at Mumbai went smoothly. The lounge is a shared one at Mumbai but nice and the staff excellent. Mumbai to Dubai was on an old 777 but was suitable for this length flight. The seat is comfortable and spacious, and the IFE screen of reasonable resolution and had a good selection. Food was fine. The lounge at Dubai is not a particularly good one in my opinion as it is huge and chaotic and not a particularly nice layout. I appreciate this is only business not first, but still would have preferred less of a corridor feel to it, as well as self service drinks areas dotted about. Dubai to Gatwick leg was excellent. The superior level of the seat is significant and avod is excellent. The cabin crew on this flight were friendly and attentive. The only very minor niggle is that the food and wine service were not coordinated at all, so the wine was served after the meal rather than with it. This was after two glasses of champagne and a gin and tonic though so no real complaint. The big let down was Gatwick airport where we were not offered premium service for immigration.

We were denied boarding on the pretext that we were late at the gate - never mind that there was no one to receive us at the terminal, Emirates flight from Delhi was late and that last few passengers were still boarding right in front of us. Staff at the gate were rude, turned us away and asked us to get our re-routing from the Emirates customer service. With 2 kids who were sleepy and exhausted, we made our way to a long queue at the customer service counter. They routed us to Accra via Abuja and on my husbands persistent query assured us that Abuja had transit facilities. The situation in Abuja was far from this - no transit, we were made to collect our bags by paying for passenger trolleys, re-check in at Arik Air and fight customs / immigration who insisted on stamping our passports. The Arik Air flight was delayed, there was no business class lounge at the airport and the flight itself was a small propeller aircraft. We were happy to reach Accra in one piece after the harrowing experience. On registering a complaint with Emirates we were advised that they would investigate and needed 30 days - at the end of this period they came back with no admittance of guilt but offered us 15,000 frequent flyer points each which to date they have not credited to my children's account. Contrast this with our recent experience on Eithopian where we were transported from the tarmac when they were late on a flight from ACC to NBO and even connected our bags. Did not expect Emirates to treat business class passengers in this manner. They clearly are now such a big airline that they could not be bothered by these exceptions - imagine how they treat non-gold, economy class travelers - am glad to see other airlines now catching up with them.",8,2016-02-29,Ghana,False,booked fly new delhi accra via dubai business class emirate aug layover hr min dubai flight delhi took min late circled dubai landing remote corner airport rushed reached boarding gate min departure last economy passenger boarding denied boarding pretext late gate never mind one receive u terminal emirate flight delhi late last passenger still boarding right front u staff gate rude turned u away asked u get routing emirate customer service kid sleepy exhausted made way long queue customer service counter routed u accra via abuja husband persistent query assured u abuja transit facility situation abuja far transit made collect bag paying passenger trolley check arik air fight custom immigration insisted stamping passport arik air flight delayed business class lounge airport flight small propeller aircraft happy reach accra one piece harrowing experience registering complaint emirate advised would investigate needed day end period came back admittance guilt offered u frequent flyer point date credited child account contrast recent experience eithopian transported tarmac late flight acc nbo even connected bag expect emirate treat business class passenger manner clearly big airline could bothered exception imagine treat non gold economy class traveler glad see airline catching

We were very pleased in all respects with Emirates. The check in both in Gatwick and Dubai was swift and efficient. On board the seating was fine with plenty of leg room and the meals served were tasty. The best aspect is the in flight entertainment system which has a huge variety of films and TV and large screens to make viewing a pleasure and cameras on the plane so you can watch the take off and landing from the pilot's view.

Young kids needs milk, is it not obvious or let parents carry them. Irony is they ran out of milk when asked for second time. In a 15 hour flight is it not reasonable for a parent to ask another serving of milk for toddler.

"From the moment I checked in, Emirates managed to make a mess of things. I asked the agent at the check in counter if I could use the lounge with my One World emerald status (Platinum with Qatar Airways), given that QF and EK code share the flight I was checking in for. She took my card then mistakenly entered the membership number with QF instead of QR. I didn't notice her error until I arrived at the QF lounge and was promptly denied entry. EK also switched my seat without informing me. When I asked about it at the gate, I was told that there was a note in the record that my seat had been changed in order to allow a family to sit together. That is fine, but EK could have at least had the courtesy to inform me at check in. Onboard, FAs did the minimum. I asked for a bandage for a small cut on my finger which the FA completely forgot about. The best was when I asked for ketchup to accompany my breakfast of hash browns and a frittata - exactly the sort of dishes one would eat with ketchup. I was informed that ketchup is only available in business and first class. What? Is ketchup the new Dom Perignon? Give me a break. Requests with the call button went ignored. Last time I flew with EK was in business class from NBO-KWI via DXB. I didn't find it to be a very good experience.

"Hamburg to Bangkok via Dubai. Different service experiences. Flight HAM-DXB (EK 60) was on time, First was fully booked. Very good service by 2 attentive FA's and the purser. Wines were outstanding, 40 year old Port, excellent Cognac. Emirates First class food is a bit boring compared to Singapore Airlines and others where you can book your main course in advance. The second leg (EK 384 with A380) was a bad experience. Before take off in DXB I ordered my shower to have it 1.5hrs before landing. I was woken up very rudely by a female FA (she knocked loud on the door of my suite - on all flights before the FA's opened the door and woke up smoothly) and led me to the shower room. Normally in the meantime the FA's clean the suite and change the bed into a seat. When I came back after 20 minutes, nothing had happened, so I called the FA. Unwillingly she did their job and went away. Normally after having the shower the passenger were asked for their breakfast order. My FA was chatting with another pax and when some minutes later I called her and asked for breakfast she looked at her watch and told me, that in about 10 to 15 minutes we would start the descent and she could not serve me. I now asked for the purser and a little later I got my breakfast. The purser later came to me and apologized and told me, that he is not very happy that Emirates needs so much new staff and that today after too short a time FA's can serve in First Class.

"In December last year I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare. Let me apologise to our fellow passengers if they suffered on our account. The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome. As the attendant near me gave the safety demonstration, one of our babies whimpered a little. She rolled her eyes and groaned at the prospect of the voyage ahead. Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was their with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves. The seventy-two year old granny must have looked a fright as I walked in circles trying to lull the baby off to sleep! Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes, much to the distress of my little autistic grandson! I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again - different attendant - same story! I was forced to sit bolt upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! I would probably have been more comfortable in Economy! I would have thought that an Airline that advertises a high quality experience should be able to do better. They would have known our party was coming on board. One would have thought that for the sake of the other passengers the staff might have offered to help. Emirates always boast about how many different countries the attendants come from.

"We flew Emirates from Madrid to Dubai and we were shocked that the 777-300 was configured 3-4-3 on this aircraft and not the standard 3-3-3 as usually found on other airlines who operate the type, this, along with extrememly tight seat pitch made for a very uncomfortable flight. Ground service was good, no delays, no baggage problems and the IFE is excellent. Cabin crew seemed scattered and uncoordinated, the men do the donkey work whilst most of the girls seem to have been chosen for their looks rather than their ability to do the job. Dinner was served over two hours into the flight, ie, almost midnight, reasonable grilled chicken and bean salad starter followed by a choice of roast chicken or ragout of lamb. By the time they got to us they'd run out of the lamb, hardly surprising, so we got chicken for our main course too: dry as a bone, served with some sloppy veg. Breakfast wasn't offered, not even juice, just a choice of coffee or tea. One drinks service before dinner. A huge disappointment after all the hype we'd heard about Emirates.

"Bangkok to Sydney with Emirates. The check in was good. Lounge was okay if very full, and the absence of flight boards was inexplicable in an airline-dedicated lounge. The food and drink adequate/above average for a small lounge. Boarding was prompt but only because I ignored the staff in the lounge and headed to the gate before the flight was called. I was amongst the first into the cabin but the rest of the Business passengers in the long missed priority boarding, which would have been inconvenient as within a few minutes the economy passengers were queuing through Business. Onboard the Business cabin felt cramped. The 2-3-2 configuration left little room for manoeuvre. There is no sense of privacy and aisle access is poor for many. The overhead locker over my seat was full of spare towels so I had to use another. Virtually no storage space around the seat other than a hole for shoes that was too small to take both of my (average sized) shoes and a front pocket on the back of the seat in front. IFE selection was adequate. Screen was large but situated in the back of the seat in front so the touch screen capability was redundant as it was well out of reach. Oddly there is no feature which stops it being seen from any angle, so in a D seat such as mine I could easily see 7 or 8 other screens. Not great if you have young children as they will perhaps see things you would prefer them not to. Also not great if the person beside you is watching the same movie as you - but has started it earlier. Complicated mini touch screen and separate controller system were not intuitive. I found the seat uncomfortable. Poorly situated armrests were at different levels and the internal one was too small. Very limited position options. The seat does not go fully flat nor to 180 degrees and when lying down I could not stretch out fully - and I am 175cm/5ft 9 inches tall. For me the key issue is the seat and so on this aspect alone I would not normally fly Emirates. The power port is recessed so that it cannot take an iPad or MacBook charger as there is insufficient room. Service was slow, an hour and 15 minutes after takeoff no drinks had been served, this on an overnight flight of 9 hours scheduled duration. Food arrived almost 2 hours after takeoff. It was OK but no more than that. The table is a good size and presentation was good. Service generally was not great. I asked for a second drink and it did not arrive after 10 minutes. Similarly I asked for earplugs from a different attendant which again did not arrive. The complimentary Bulgari washbag is large but contains unnecessary items such as large aftershave bottles - but no earplugs! There were only two toilets for 42 passengers. Definitely insufficient, it only took one person to be 5 mins plus for a long queue to build. The flight attendant apologized and told me that it was always like that. Flight arrived on time. Summary. The product feels like it is at least 10 years out of date. The main issue is the seat and configuration. Well below a Cathay, Qantas, Singapore, JAL or even BA. I understand that the A380 fitout may be better but I'll continue to avoid Emirates.",8,2016-01-31,United Kingdom,False,bangkok sydney emirate check good lounge okay full absence flight board inexplicable airline dedicated lounge food drink adequate average small lounge boarding prompt ignored staff lounge headed gate flight called amongst first cabin rest business passenger long missed priority boarding would inconvenient within minute economy passenger queuing business onboard business cabin felt cramped configuration left little room manoeuvre sense privacy aisle access poor many overhead locker seat full spare towel use another virtually storage space around seat hole shoe small take average sized shoe front pocket back seat front ife selection adequate screen large situated back seat front touch screen capability redundant well reach oddly feature stop seen angle seat mine could easily see screen great young child perhaps see thing would prefer also great person beside watching movie started earlier complicated mini touch screen separate controller system intuitive found seat uncomfortable poorly situated armrest different level internal one small limited position option seat go fully flat degree lying could stretch fully cm ft inch tall key issue seat aspect alone would normally fly emirate power port recessed cannot take ipad macbook charger insufficient room service slow hour minute takeoff drink served overnight flight hour scheduled duration food arrived almost hour takeoff ok table good size presentation good service generally great asked second drink arrive minute similarly asked earplug different attendant arrive complimentary bulgari washbag large contains unnecessary item large aftershave bottle earplug two toilet passenger definitely insufficient took one person min plus long queue build flight attendant apologized told always like flight arrived time summary product feel like least year date main issue seat configuration well cathay qantas singapore jal even ba understand fitout may better continue avoid emirate

Dubai to Sydney in an A380, crew were friendly but could not seem to get it together. I was travelling with a partner and food only came to one of us and not together, every single time my food orders were incorrect. Meals are getting smaller and are the same on other routes.

"Emirates once more offered a fantastic product, to bring me from Dubai to Frankfurt. The experience started with this unique Emirates chauffeur-Service, dropping me off at Dubai airport, just some steps away from a smooth check-in. Security and passport-control were easy and the lounge outstanding. It is huge, more like a First Class Terminal. It is important to keep in mind, that the airport is quite big, it took 15 minutes to walk from Check-in to the lounge and 15 minutes from the lounge to the gate. Boarding was well organized and efficient. This time, there was no airbridge to the upper deck, but this was not a problem, as the A380 was not fully booked. Priority boarding made it easy to get on the aircraft. Service was outstanding and the crew great, cheerful and friendly. Even when you did not have a meal at the lounge, it is nearly impossible to taste all the delices of the menu. Meal service is on demand, whenever you want it. Comfort is excellent, not only because of the shower and the seat/bed. This aircraft is so quiet! Onboard Wifi worked well during 2/3 of the flight, 500 MB for 1 USD is a fair deal. At Frankfurt, priority delivery of luggage (own belt for First an Business) worked well and with a waiting chauffeur-service, the way home was as easy as it could get.

"Melbourne to Auckland with Emirates. 30-45 minutes late in takeoff, they said it was due to cleaners, anyway eventually we were allowed to board. The plane was nice, the seats looked comfortable enough and it was certainly clean. The FA's however were conspicuous in their absence. Once boarded, we didn't see them again till we were served a meal. About an hour or so before we landed I asked one FA about landing cards to fill in. She said they had run out of them as they ""never give us enough"" and we would probably have to fill in once we landed however to her credit she called around and found a pile more. Not sure why this wasn't done when they had run out earlier? Anyway that was sorted. They also asked for coin donations to a children's fund, so we had our coins ready but no one came for them.

"On 14 January I received an email stating that my flight from Dubai to Panama (EK0251) on 3rd March had been cancelled. I was not given an explanation and I not given suggested options. I phoned the local Emirates office and spent 56 minutes on the phone to try and fix this at my own cost. We were offered a refund, but at this late notice we would not have found affordable alternatives. The first option I was given was to go via Houston and miss my connecting flight from Panama to Quito. The second option was via Sao Paulo. My original flight landed at 16:40 on 4 March. I had booked accommodation in Panama for the night of the 4th to recover from the longest flight in the world. My new flight lands at 6:49am on 5 March. I will now be spending two nights travelling including a layover from 6pm to 2am in the São Paulo airport. I was not offered any options to make this less horrible. I was not offered an upgrade on one of the legs or access to a lounge in Sao Paulo. In addition, it was only explained to me after I had agreed to this route change that the flight from Sao Paulo to Panama will be with Copa Airlines - not Emirates. As we are travelling with surfboards, this will cost us money. I wrote a complaint to Emirates and received an email stating that on cases such as these, they are unable to offer lounge access or an upgrade.

The crew looks at you and says yes, but then they disappear so you have to ask another crew member - and if you are lucky, the third or the fourth one will finally get you what you want!

"Gatwick to Hong Kong via Dubai on Emirates. Check in and boarding at Gatwick smooth and departed on time. My pre booked seat was changed to accommodate a family but my reassigned seat was still an aisle which was my preference. The drink trolley took a long time to come around and was followed by the food trolley. Meal was braised beef which was OK, but only lukewarm. The entertinment was OK but headphone socket was dodgy so only had sound in one ear. Landed on time in Dubai but the queues for security were horrendous. Easy transfer to A terminal and the flight on a newer A380 took off about 30 minutes late. Again, trolley service was vey slow and cabin crew seemed to do a poor job. As this was a 3am departure only a sandwich and drink was served before the lights went out. Prior to landing in Hong Kong a hot breakfast was served which was OK. Scrambled egg, baked beans, spinach, veg hash brown. Immigration at HKG took forever then had to wait ages for bags to be delivered to the carousel.

"Kuala Lumpur to Heathrow via Dubai, and returning from London Gatwick through Dubai with Emirates, in economy. I am very impressed with the experience on each flight I took. There were no major delays to speak of, the food was actually very good (minus the strange fishy starters), drinks were plentiful and they had a great database of entertainment. The tail mounted cameras are a fantastic feature and the wifi worked well - but only on 2 of the flights. The crew couldn't do enough to help, they were friendly and helpful it was refreshing compared to some airlines I have been on. One downside I found on all flights was that it took over an hour for the FAs to get the drinks trollies and begin service. Each time they started serving from the front of the cabin, which for me was fine as I was at the front - while the people in the back looked on longingly. The check-in staff at Gatwick were really miserable. Other than that, everything was perfect. The first of four legs was on the Boeing 777-300ER with 10 abreast seating. Yes the aisles are a little narrow but as there was nobody next to me it wasn't a problem. I'm 5'11 and 70kg - sat in the aisle seat and wasn't hit very often. Maybe a larger person may feel more uncomfortable, especially if the middle seat were occupied. The other 3 legs on the A380 were better. The seats were roomy and spacious, and on the DXB - KUL route the plane was 10 days old. The flight was empty and there were only about 12 people in a cabin of 120(ish) seats so the crew and I spent half the flight talking as there was little for them to do. 68A was a great seat as it has nobody in front. Overall, very pleased with how well everything went!

"Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur with Emirates, and I arrived on New Years Day in Kuala Lumpur to discover that my wallet had fallen out of my carry on bag, and the first thing I did on entering the airport was look for it. Staff were unhelpful and the ground crew refused to let me back on the plane to check. I understand this may be policy but nothing was explained.  After waiting to no avail I went to collect my luggage, but to my horror no luggage appeared. The staff representing Emirates had no help or a kind word to offer, and could not tell me where my bags were. The best I could do was make my way to my hotel and wait. My bags turned up the following day. On my return flight, accompanied by my partner, we found that they had changed our pre-selected seats and we were not seated together. We did not notice this until we were through immigration, and then had to talk our way back through so that we could convince the check-in desk to re-seat us -  a huge waste of time. Waiting for our luggage at Melbourne airport at 2:00am it turned out they had misplaced my luggage again, as well as my partners this time. This led to more time spent at the lost baggage counter, and having to sit at home for the better part of the next day waiting for it to be delivered. All up I would say that I wasted at least 8 hours on unnecessary mistakes, not to mention the distress caused, which was certainly not alleviated by their very unhelpful staff.

"Flew Durban to Seattle via Dubai on Emirates Boeing 777s. Durban to Dubai was very bumpy almost the entire 8 hours, so cabin service was limited to a single meal and a single drink prior to that meal. Cabin crew were fine, not overly friendly but definitely not hostile. The warm towels were a nice touch. Seat was a not terribly crowded aisle seat in row 41 made all the more comfortable by the fact that the person in front of me did not recline. Thank you! Inflight entertainment offerings were somewhat limited (just 400 channels) but far superior to SAA's offerings. Flight was very full in economy. Dubai to Seattle leg is a long ride: 13 hours over Iran, Russia and the north pole. Cabin service again was very good. The meal was ok; a promising chicken dish in a mustard sauce that lacked flavor when delivered but the rest of the meal was quite good. Cabin crew offered pizza a couple of hours before landing.  I was seated in a window seat on this leg which felt more crowded because I had people next to me and the guy seated in front of me reclined to the max as soon as he could and stayed that way the entire flight! IFE on this leg (ICE) was outstanding, over 1000 different selections including several Mozart channels plus a whole season of The Big Bang Theory! Plane was very full in economy. Overall, a pretty good experience for such a long ride. Booked 14 days in advance and still got what I consider to be a great price considering the distance and how full the plane was when I booked.

"Hong Kong to Glasgow via Dubai with Emirates. The bar was a highlight of the first leg of my flight. The food on Emirates lacks a certain something. Not sure what it is but the menu just doesn't seem inspiring. Beverages on the other hand are plentiful, varied and excellent. My seat on the A380 was comfortable but I feel boxed in on those seats. The one on the 777 was a pain in the butt. I wanted to do some work on the plane but my lights shone into the face of the person seated beside me on the 777. My personal reading light did not work at all. Further to this, the lounge in Dubai is not a pleasant relaxing environment. There are just too many people running around. Not great at 3am when all you want is a good rest. I ended up going down to my gate where everyone was a lot less manic and chilled out on the comfortable long loungers. The chauffeur service was excellent, my driver going above and beyond the call of duty to deliver a great service in Glasgow. My return flight was the contentious one. I'd chosen my seat when booking, an aisle seat because I'm very tall - when I went online to check in, I find my seat has been re-allocated without even being informed. Not an obligation on their part of course but it would be nice to know. Ended up upgrading to business rather than deal with middle seat in economy. In a rare act for one so afraid of flying as myself, I managed to focus on the entertainment for more than ten minutes without losing myself to panic. Managed to watch live football which was a great and pleasant surprise!

"Auckland to Newcastle via Dubai and I was very disappointed with the service. They had run out of food options so we only had one choice, the staff were unhelpful. My coffee fell off my tray onto my seat, I told the stewardess and she handed me five napkins and walked away.

I thought she was coming back so I was reluctant to fall asleep, I sat on my soaked blanket to soak up the coffee on the chair. Half an hour later she didn't return so I had to ask a third member of the crew. The crew were rude about getting the trolleys past us and when they hit a man's foot they didn't apologise. They looked stressed and annoyed during the flight safety announcement. When they brought round the warm towels the stewardess handed one to the person next to me then noticed she had none left to give me. She said ""oh"" and walked away.

"The London-Dubai leg was great because we got an Emirates A380 and it was generally a comfortable experience with minimal bumps. The service was also exceptional with the attendants appearing warm and friendly while the food was decent. The leg from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur was a whole different story. The plane felt old and gaudy. For 4 hours of a 6 hour journey, we were subjected to so much turbulence that it made it terribly difficult to do anything. Nobody could go to the bathroom too and so I spent 4 hours having to hold my bladder in. The passengers lose all sense of comfort and peace of mind when we have to experience a heavily bumpy journey for a protracted period of time. I was assigned seat 21H due to its accessibility to the bathroom. If anyone chooses this seat, I promise you that you would be subjected to people's butts brushing against your arm for the entire flight. I've had the flight attendants rush past me hitting my arm repeatedly without ever apologizing.  They would grab your food trays without asking too.

"Nightmare Emirates flight from Dubai to London. We were on our 2nd leg of our journey from Sri Lanka to UK on 5th January. First the flight was delayed from 4.10 to 5.00. Then 45 mins into the flight we were informed by the Captain that there was a problem with the undercarriage and we would be turning back to Dubai. After dumping fuel and circling for a further 2 hrs in Dubai, we landed back in Dubai at 9.00pm. Then we had to wait in a queue with just 2 people at the counter to get docs to go to a Hotel. It was taking for ever. After collecting docs they were asked to go to yet another counter to leave the duty free items bought. It was utter chaos, children were crying, there were a lot of very tired passengers. Finally after a very long time and the Management woke up to the crisis, they offered food and the business lounge for some of the passengers, which we took up. I am totally shocked at the Emirates response to this incident. No regard to the passengers and what they had gone thru. They had over 3 hrs to organise the vouchers for the Hotels and transport for the passengers. Yet they kept passengers waiting longer with their laidback attitude.

"New York to Dubai. After having flown with various American airlines over the last 8 months I’m relieved to be back on Emirates. The first class on the A380 is everything it should be. Love the privacy of their suite and comfort of the seat, may it be in an upright position, lounge or as a fully flat bed with a separate mattress which is excellent for sleeping. The catering is on-demand, with an amazing selection of food. I tend to over-eat on such flights for I’m eager to try everything. And drink everything. I wasn’t disappointed. Everything I tried was top notch quality and taste. IFE is incredible with an amazing collection of movies and TV shows. And the 32-inch screen is a pleasure to watch. The piece-de-resistance is the shower that sets them apart. The surprisingly disappointing feature on this flight was their internet. Given how heavily they promote online connectivity while flying and the free (or nearly free) service, it is also a frustratingly slow experience. This is something that needs to improve.

"Rome to Jakarta via Dubai with Emirates, and terrible in-flight service. Was calling for a flight attendant to help pull the screen from the side of my seat and had to wait for at least 30 minutes before one showed up and that was for the inflight meal service. Then she just stared at me and did not move a muscle until I requested her to help pull out the tv screen. Without waiting for any of us to pull out our tray table, the flight attendant just distributed the lunch trays and they were on our laps. Terrible! Despite asking for an aisle seat for both legs of my journey, I got a middle seat for the second leg of my journey. The ground crew behind the counter failed to tell me that I will get a middle seat as perhaps no other aisle seats were available.

"Glasgow to Tokyo Narita via Dubai with Emirates, and on both legs of my trip the seat and service provided by the cabin crew was excellent, however there were a few items to mention. The first was that at Dubai we had a 25 minute bus tour of the airport complex from the gate to reach the plane flying the second leg. No real inconvenience but it felt slightly odd to be on the bus driving around for so long. The second issue was with the food that was served on the Tokyo flight. I had the oriental vegetarian meal booked and I genuinely have no idea what the main portion of my meal was. I was served an odd flavorless mush that resembled wallpaper paste which I couldn't eat, so I had to abandon it and instead have some of the pastries the cabin crew brought round with the coffee.

"I have now flown return from Perth to London Heathrow via Dubai with Emirates on two separate occasions, and each trip has been poor. My expectations had been high which is perhaps why each trip has been a disappointment. I have encountered long delays in flight departures waiting on the tarmac on at least half of the legs flown as flights seem to seldom leave on time. The cabin staff are unfriendly and the entertainment selection is the worst I have encountered. You are hard pushed to find a film title you even recognize in the list of new releases. On two occasions my meal choice has been unavailable (despite being seating fairly close to the start of service) and obtaining a drink (water not alcohol) outside of the allocated service times is as if you have asked for the moon on a stick. Meal quality is however pretty good. Seats are generally comfortable and provide ample space for a long haul flight.

The crew gave the impression that they would rather be anywhere other than serving on that aircraft.

"Mauritius to Dusseldorf via Dubai. The advantage of Emirates are quite modern aircraft with spacious seats, and attractive pricing for business class. The disadvantage is that you'll have an extra stop-over at Dubai. It looks like that Emirates puts more emphasis on languages spoken onboard by its crew, than the quality of their job performance. On two out of four flights on this vacation, I found that the crew assigned to my section were very professional. The other two flights the crew were sloppy or inadequately trained. On one flight I had to move to another seat because the headrest was broken. (I am quite tall person, and therefore a headrest that is so loose that it immediately drops to the lowest position, is not acceptable for me). When moving to an empty seat a stewardess told me that she had received several reports of seat problems on that flight. Because of the quality of the customer service of Emirates, my overall rating is low. It took one week to get a standard answer to one of the two issues I reported. This standard answer was obvious not applicable to my situation. I then asked for a relevant answer on both issue, but after an month I haven't received any answer at all.

In flight entertainment was good and the screen is really large, but the headsets are extremely bad. The food is acceptable, nothing exciting. Cabin staff was efficient and friendly.

"Colombo to Copenhagen via Dubai return. Emirates advertise that a business class ticket include a hotel in Dubai when you travel through this city and that you pick up the voucher in the airport prior to embarkation. We booked online and at the same time reserved the hotels and received confirmation on the hotels as well as of travel tickets during the booking process. In Copenhagen on the way to Colombo this worked as advertised and we were able to break up the journey into two 5-6 hr flights by staying overnight in Dubai. However, on our return flight no voucher was receivable in Colombo and we were told to pick it up in Dubai. In Dubai we were sent from counter to counter in the very large airport and were finally told that no hotel voucher would be issued. The argument used was that although you book online you have to call the Emirate office afterwards to confirm the booking! Apparently this is written somewhere in the small print of the ""conditions for sale"". In other words you may book online but you can't rely on the confirmation received during booking but have to call the office anyway.

The premium lane for immigration really made the airport experience easy. The lounge in Bangkok was excellent and food good, although there was no area seated for first class passengers. On board this time, again the seat was the highlight; personal bar and amenities highly appreciated. Food again was tasteless and disappointing. Cabin staff were friendly. The purser however was never seen, and as a first class passenger I expect to be made to feel a little more important to the airline especially as a frequent flyer member. I would have expected to be greeted by the purser. Announcements were mundane and without particular emphasis on polite service.

The lounge in Hong Kong was adequate but busy with no separate area for first class passengers. Onboard, the seat is amazing with it's own bar and an ability to close yourself in the suite. Very good. My wife was in 4K however, and that was a noisy seat with a lot of galley noise, not really first class! Food was disappointing with overcooked chicken and half of the menu items not even offered. At no time was I offered cheese or chocolates which are on the menu. The lights in the shower suites were not working and the flight attendant opened the door once when my wife was in there using the toilet.

The crew on the Boeing 777 coming back to LGW seemed more efficient and friendly than any of the A380 crews. The IFE is outstanding on Emirates, so much to choose from. The drawback for flying on Boeing 777 for me was having to be bussed to some remote stand at Dubai, it took ages to get to the plane.

"My husband and I flew Emirates from Lusaka to Dubai, on the way to China during mid September. We are Platinum and Gold card holders respectively, and frequent fliers of Emirates on the Lusaka-Dubai route on Business class. We were upgraded from Business Class to First Class for this specific flight, and were appalled at the quality of the A340 Premium products. For all the wonderful advertisements (and personal experiences) on premium products on the A380s and B777s, the product on the LUN-DXB sector is something that definitely needs to change. Business Class seats themselves are not fully flat beds, only the old cradle seats, hence was pleased to be upgraded to First Class, but we weren't aware of what was coming. We got First Class seats where the recline and leg rests were not working. Hence was made to stand and wait 20 minutes in the aisle while the flight attendants tried to manually recline our seats. Although this was done, the leg rest was not able to be manually reclined, hence was given boxes, yes boxes and pillows in order to rest our legs. For one of the so called best airlines in the world, that is completely unacceptable. This is something that no one should experience on First class, especially if someone pays the very high fares Emirates offers. To make things worse, when complaining through email to Emirates, we got a response saying ""technical faults can develop at any point,"" implying that even if you pay more for a Business/First class seat, there is no guarantee that you will get a good seat on Emirates.",1,2015-12-21,Zambia,False,husband flew emirate lusaka dubai way china mid september platinum gold card holder respectively frequent flier emirate lusaka dubai route business class upgraded business class first class specific flight appalled quality premium product wonderful advertisement personal experience premium product b product lun dxb sector something definitely need change business class seat fully flat bed old cradle seat hence pleased upgraded first class aware coming got first class seat recline leg rest working hence made stand wait minute aisle flight attendant tried manually recline seat although done leg rest able manually reclined hence given box yes box pillow order rest leg one called best airline world completely unacceptable something one experience first class especially someone pay high fare emirate offer make thing worse complaining email emirate got response saying technical fault develop point implying even pay business first class seat guarantee get good seat emirate

"Flew Brisbane to Auckland return on Emirates A380's. We were delayed on the tarmac in Brisbane for the Brisbane - Auckland flight due to the power shutting down on the plane when taxiing back from the gate. The pilot said he had to reset some computer settings and then the power came back on. Then as we were taxiing, he stopped and advised that the water system wasn't working. So he was going to do some resetting on the tarmac to see if the computers could reset the water supply. After about an hour of this, he went back to the gate to have engineers look at it (another 45 mins or so) and finally we were on our way 2 hours late. It wasn't very comforting to hear the pilot not finish sentences on occasion when giving us updates - it was as though he drifted off! Also, my husband's headset was broken, he asked for a new one but unfortunately a new headset never arrived. If it had been a longer flight, he would have followed this up. The food was pretty cold due to the delay, and there was the rudest male cabin supervisor I've ever come across. I went to ask for some water from the galley (as after the service, the cabin crew do a pretty good job of disappearing to avoid being asked for service I guess). I was standing there for a few minutes and he knew it, and he never even asked how he could help. I had to ask him! He basically ignored me and was generally grumpy when and unsmiling when he did go up and down the aisle during the service.

"I am a regular traveler between Dubai and Los Angeles and notice if there is any improvements made on this route since the last trip in June 2015. Overall journey was pleasant, departure was nearly half-an-hour late due to offloading luggage of passengers who could not travel that day, but the captain promised to make up the time lost throughout the flight. Arrival was on time as scheduled. A380 a joy to travel in. What could be better is if the departure gate in Dubai allows for 2 level entries, as premium passengers were boarded through the lower entry door, which could be problematic for elderly passengers as they have to go up on a stairs to the business cabin. Male amenity kit bag has been shrunk which is good. The content remains the same. The service is good with crew members working hard.

On boarding the aircraft we were greeted by miserable cabin crew so got the feeling it wasn't going to be a great flight and we were correct.

"We couldn't have asked for a better ending for a week long vacation in the UAE, as we flew back to India on an Emirates A380. I was glad that all the excitement paid off with this flight. EK500 operating on the DXB-BOM sector had already occupied its gate (B20), even before we cleared our formalities. The flight, needless to say is big and the number of people waiting to get on board is a clear sign of that. The cabin crew on board were polite and never dropped their smile throughout the flight duration. The legspace gets in more inches than a B777 (that we used for BOM-DXB) and the windows seem more larger. The night time ambient lighting adds to the drama with all the buttons overhead at the touch of a remote. The in-flight entertainment provides all the details of the flight and the most amazing outdoor camera locations one can ask for during the flight. The food was pretty good, if not exceptional and we were more than happy with the fact that it was piping hot. The cabin is very quiet once the Rolls Royce's are burnt at full throttle and you can hardly feel any vibrations.

"Our flight (EK507) got delayed by an hour and it left quite a sour experience at the start of our vacation.  The aircraft was well maintained and the crew were quite welcoming right from the door. The food served on board was of decent quality, but they ran out of the non-vegetarian course by the time the trolley reached my seat. We landed around 45 minutes after our schedulued arrival, and we missed our connecting bus (Emirates shuttle) to Abu Dhabi, as it left sharp at 7 PM. The surprising part about all this is that Emirates dont take any liability for missed bus connections, as it is apparently hosted by a 3rd party.

The cabin crew service from Dubai to Shanghai was rude and impatient.

The stars on the ceiling of the plane when it is dark outside was a nice touch.

I ordered a lacto-ovo diet and in my past experience, I was given sandwich and some dessert/cake, however this time I was a bit disappointed that I was only given 1 piece of vegetarian rolls. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing, and the best onboard breakfast that I have had. Emirates also provide stickers so flight attendants know whether to wake up or not. Inflight entertainment was superb, plenty of choices and the front/bottom aircraft camera view was available. The ICE on this aircraft hasn't been upgraded yet (wasn't ICE widescreen) but still enjoyable. Wi-fi was also available in this flight for those who prefer browsing to watching the IFE, and the connection speed was pretty fast.

They provided a menu which they usually do with 3 options. However the vegetarian option in the menu (both breakfast and lunch) was available only for those who had pre selected meal preferences. Not sure how it makes sense to include something in the menu when it is not really available for selection. Secondly, their flights are freezing cold and flight attendants always seem to be in a hurry to collect blankets.

Having always put it close to me in the plane I always travel with a softcase. This time I travelled to Boston I was coerced at Karachi airport and given absolutely no choice but to check in my guitar. Knowing the fragility of a guitar it is unacceptable to check it in regardless of all fragile handling protocol an airline may have. A guitar is too sensitive to be checked in.

Singapore to Chicago via Dubai with Emirates. The crew were impatient and demanded to take away all the blankets 45mins prior to landing. Passengers were rudely awaken from their sleep during this freezing red eye flight and had blankets taken away. The crew then proceeded to collect all headsets in a very rude manner. I assume all these is to help turn around the aircraft quicker but this results in a very horrible flying experience. Not to mention the food is also cold and of poor quality.

"This is my 6th Business class trip this year with Emirates. Checking was done in Melbourne by Qantas, all went smoothly. The EK lounge in Sydney is a nice and cosy. Great food and service. Boarding the flight was a nightmare, there was no priority lane in place, it was a dogs breakfast. I have never encountered that before on any airlines. After take off, we were given mattresses straight away - how about asking priority passengers what they would like to drink after take off and what their meal requests would be? That was a first. The crew always give the mattresses after dining. Just very strange and not logical. I was seating in 7K which was located at the very front section of the business class. After a long 1h30, we were given our departure drink and cold nuts, then asked to chose our dinner. No wine request was offered with the meal, we had to ask for it. I've asked for my cheese platter to be served after I finish my main meal. I got my starter, the chicken roulade and salad - I had to send back my meal, the whole food that I just got was far too chilled. There were pieces of ice on the Salad and the chicken, I just couldn't believe what was served on my plate.  No coffee or tea were offered to my section, no refill of our drinks or bread and I never got my cheese platter. By that stage, I've had enough. 2 hours before landing, I've ordered a Lite Bites, waited only 5 minutes which I thought was pretty amazing considering during the flight I've had to press the Call Button 3-4 times to get some water (then asked for a big bottle therefore I was sure to have the water when I needed it and without disrupting the crew) well my snack was cold so I had to send it back again! The crew who were designated to look after my section really failed on that flight, they were non existent during the flight, didn't care one bit about their passengers.

"Melbourne to Rome via Kuala Lumpur & Dubai. My husband and I booked a trip to Italy with our two young children. The flight is around 21 hrs not including transfers & upon recommendations from several friends we decided to travel with Emirates. I do not have one good thing to say about them! We experienced every family's worst fears about international plane travel with everything from poor, slow service, judgemental staff, pathetic kids meals (the kids were served spaghetti bolognaise on 5/6 flights), rude staff refusing to give the kids their 'complimentary' toy (which we had to beg for!), and to top it all off we had all been separated on one flight, despite booking our seats online. My four year old son and seven year old daughter were sitting 10 and 15 rows away from myself with my husband sitting another 7 rows behind me! All up we were spread right through the economy cabin and no-one wanted to help us, each blaming the next point of transfer as the responsible party. Originally I made an online complaint to Emirates while on holiday, hoping at the bare minimum, they'd be able to offer some palatable food to our children inflight. The response I got, as well as being ridiculously late and outside the timeframe given, was pathetic; suggesting I should just bring my own food in future, with no useful advice or empathy shown!

"My husband and I purchased tickets for $38,000. to fly first class on Emirates from San Francisco to Johannesburg via Dubai. It was going to be our ""trip of a lifetime"" so we spent the extra money to try the first class experience we had heard so much about. We boarded the plane and were served drinks, but about an hour later we had to de-plane due to an electrical failure. We waited in the airport and were given hourly updates for the next 5-7 hours while we waited to board again and take off. Eventually the flight was cancelled. We got no information at the airport from Emirates about what to do, where to go, or how to rebook. After several more hours getting our bags and finding our way out of the airport we bumped into a fellow passenger who told us Emirates would pay for a room at a local hotel. We went to the hotel and were not able to get information about rebooking our flight until 2:00 am. The flight went out the following day but involved 2 hours of waiting in line to get checked in. My husband is blind and I had one leg in a cast so the delay was really excruciating. We were awarded 100,000 Skyward miles for the inconvenience. The delay caused us to lose out on the first day of our Safari which cost us roughly $2000, and we could not recoup. I wrote a letter to Emirates saying that we understood these mechanical problems do happen but given the cost of our ticket we wanted better compensation.  I got a polite letter back telling us basically ""no"" that they had done all they were going to do, and that was the end of it.

What a relief to change from Qantas to Emirates on our flight from Dubai to Brisbane. Seats in Row 57F/G chosen and were comfortable.

Manchester to Doha via Dubai return with Emirates. We arrived at the airport to find that the plane had been changed and our seats that we had carefully selected had been changed - with us scattered all over the place. This is not just an inconvenience but made worse when you are travelling with children - other cheaper airlines have noticed that we are travelling with children and have made sure we are seated together even when we have not paid extra for this (like Thomas Cook). The ground staff managed to find us seats together in the end but much further back in the plane. To make it worse they did the same thing on the way home on our Doha to Dubai flight. This time I checked just before we left and rang them - they could only seat 4 of us together and the rest were scattered. When I got home I emailed them to complain and after a long time got a reply to say that this is just how it is. I expected better for a company that sells itself as having good service and are so expensive. Its a sad day when I get better service from a holiday company chartered flight compared to Emirates. After all the messing about spoiled the flight - this is one of the best parts of the holiday for my family. If a family aren't seated together it doesn't matter what film you show or food you give.,10,2015-11-16,United Kingdom,False,manchester doha via dubai return emirate arrived airport find plane changed seat carefully selected changed u scattered place inconvenience made worse travelling child cheaper airline noticed travelling child made sure seated together even paid extra like thomas cook ground staff managed find u seat together end much back plane make worse thing way home doha dubai flight time checked left rang could seat u together rest scattered got home emailed complain long time got reply say expected better company sell good service expensive sad day get better service holiday company chartered flight compared emirate messing spoiled flight one best part holiday family family seated together matter film show food give

"Jakarta to Paris via Dubai with Boeing 777 from Jakarta to Dubai and A380 from Dubai to Paris. I was impressed with the cabin interior. The seat color was calm yet it still gave something confident. Before take-off, the flight attendants gave the menu to all passengers. Jakarta-Dubai flight was served with two meals. I was surprised with the flight attendant that has different languages, 18 in total, this would be very helpful with the passenger who couldn’t speak English very fluently. The meal for me was standard, as I could find a meal better in other airlines. I hope I could get better meal in my next flight to Paris since I thought the flight would use A380, but it was still the same. The flight attendant seemed so hurried in serving the meals. The meal to Paris was served a bit later until dinner time, and I was like starving since they didn’t give us more snack. The best thing in the flight was the IFE.

"Flying back to Jakarta from Amsterdam via Dubai. The flight from Amsterdam was more or less the same as the flight from Dubai to Paris with A380. But the flight attendant from Amsterdam to Dubai was a bit unprofessional. I asked to have my headset replaced, but it didn’t come until I asked another FA. During meal time, I saw an old couple not get the meal. When everyone had half of his meal, they still don’t get the meal. IFE was good during the whole flight. The flight Dubai to Jakarta (Boeing 777) was not as good as I had thought. For almost 1/3 of the journey I could not sleep on my seat.

"Emirates from Durban to Auckland via Dubai and Brisbane. The first flight from Durban to Dubai I cannot fault. Comfy seats, where I requested to be sat online. Great onboard entertainment, clean and really friendly, positive staff. Food was delicious and plenty to drink. My flight from Dubai to Brisbane was not so great. Second lot of security before getting on the plane that wouldn't allow me to take my water bottle that I had brought at the departure gate. Not in the seat I had allocated online for. Admittedly the rest of my negative experience I can't blame Emirates for. But I do think they should get rid of the ability to put the seat so far back. I basically had the guy in front on my lap the whole way, and I was trying to sleep by leaning on the fold up tray, when he forced his seat right back - it resulted in a limb on my head and a cricked neck.

"New York JFK to Milan. I've flown the Emirates A380 on short haul flights from BKK to HKG in First Class which is a noticeable improvement over the Business Class product. As many write, there are a number of seats in the Business Class cabin that are much worse than others. I did my homework before selecting the outbound seats. Per recommendation (traveling with a significant other), I picked seats 20 E/F that had the mini bar on the aisle, which allows you to sit closer to your friend/partner/spouse. The problem with these is that our middle armrests were so small and narrow that really only one of us could use it at a time. On our flight back to New York we opted to sit apart and chose seats 18K and 20K. These seats have the mini bar on the aisle, and you do have a nice more private experience. The huge plus of these seats is that you get lots of storage space next to your seat under the windows that is nonexistent in the other middle seat configurations (E/F and D/G). This allows you to put away your laptop bag, blanket etc, without getting up into the overhead bins during flight. This would also be the case for the ""A"" seats on the other side of the plane. We found these much more comfortable and didn't mind sitting apart for the flight. The flight attendants are very hit or miss with Emirates. On our outbound JFK-Milan flight, most were pretty bad. Not particularly helpful or available. They disappear after the very rushed dinner service. On our return flight the good FAs outnumbered the bad. The thing that agitated the most on both flights is the disregard that the attendants have for being quiet. They love to congregate and talk loudly between sections behind row 21. As well, they seemed to always getting into the overhead bins and slamming them shut. This woke me us several times. The other thing that I disliked is that the restrooms are next to the galley in the back of the Business class cabin in such a way that it almost seemed unsanitary and without privacy. You have the toilets between the lounge/bar with uncovered food, and the galley where they are preparing food. With no curtain separating the toilet section from the galley section, you have a bunch of FAs standing around on one side and guests in the bar area on the other that you must walk through to get to and from the toilet. We found the food offering pretty subpar for a business class product.

"Sydney to Bangkok with Emirates. I was unhappy with the Check-In staff member who mistakenly added the weight of my carry-on cabin bag to my Checked luggage, requiring me to repack my bags, but when I eventually got back to (different) check-in desk my checked luggage was well under the 30kgs allowed, so I ended up checking both bags and carrying the plastic bag that I was going to post as my carry-on. The difference between the two service staff was marked - this is the second time this has happened. The meals on Emirates in Economy have deteriorated in the last year or so, probably because Emirates operates a codeshare arrangement with Qantas on this route, so they are maybe catering to Qantas customers. The cabin staff are very professional and helpful, The beer on board is supermarket class offering a Dutch and USA option with a Dutch light alternative rather than options from Oceania or Asia which I would prefer, still the staff offer options rather than just what is close to hand. The wine is quite reasonable given it is cool and drunk at altitude. The in-flight entertainment is superior unless the person in front insists on fully reclining their seat even during meals which makes viewing the screen extremely unpleasant, but this is probably more a reflection on the type of passenger Emirates attracts with their code share arrangement with Qantas than on the actual seat.",10,2015-11-07,Australia,False,sydney bangkok emirate unhappy check staff member mistakenly added weight carry cabin bag checked luggage requiring repack bag eventually got back different check desk checked luggage well kg allowed ended checking bag carrying plastic bag going post carry difference two service staff marked second time happened meal emirate economy deteriorated last year probably emirate operates codeshare arrangement qantas route maybe catering qantas customer cabin staff professional helpful beer board supermarket class offering dutch usa option dutch light alternative rather option oceania asia would prefer still staff offer option rather close hand wine quite reasonable given cool drunk altitude flight entertainment superior unless person front insists fully reclining seat even meal make viewing screen extremely unpleasant probably reflection type passenger emirate attracts code share arrangement qantas actual seat

"A380 excellent aircraft. Awful Emirates service. I had high expectations of flying on this aircraft back to London from Dubai.

Requests for anything, like an extra blanket because it was so cold, are dismissed and you are left wondering if they misunderstood you or just chose to dismiss your request.

"We were planning a trip to Perth to see our daughter, tragically my wife fell ill, diagnosed terminal within a few days. Just a few weeks later on the day the flight was leaving, after an Emirates flight reminder, she died in just 7 short weeks. During her illness I tried to cancel the flight and use the money to fly my daughter back. Although I thought I had purchased one return ticket with one set of conditions that allowed cancellation, the return flight unknown to me had its own set of conditions that precluded any refund. After many emails and phone calls I was not able to cancel the flight and get a refund. After family help, with no help from Emirates, we got enough money together get my daughter home, tragically too late. During that time Emirates thanked me for my understanding and refused to help quoting terms and conditions of the return ticket and refused to consider changing a ticket to allow my daughter to fly back. They would retain my money and provide no help. During my wife’s illness MacMillan Cancer Support contacted Emirates on several occasions and attempted to help get my daughter home using the tickets or a refund on the purchased tickets.

"Flew Emirates in Business class from Budapest to Shanghai via Dubai. Check in was fast and able to use fast track security. Emirates use the Skycourt lounge in Budapest which is nothing to write home about. Cold food offering, cheap wine and some spirits. Seating was comfortable, but no natural light in the lounge at all. A330 is the Achilles heel of Emirates. I am not sure how they can get away with sending such an uncompetitive aircraft to Budapest. The seats are narrow, recline is limited and are terrible for anything more than a few hours. Food and service was excellent and the staff were very friendly and chatty.

The seat is very comfortable and offers great privacy. Being a night flight, service was limited so as to let people sleep. I put the seat in lie flat mode and slept for the best part of 6 hours.

In Business Class, Emirates offers limo pick up, which we did. I need a wheelchair, and that went very smoothly to the Business Lounge in Orlando - they were using a very small space, but nice lunch buffet. Seats 9A/B were fairly comfortable as were the other seats we had. Thank goodness for the addition of the long pad for sleeping. Remember the days of Delta being called ""Chicken airline"" because of their chicken meals, then Emirates should be called ""The Reboot airline"". On each of our four segments the computer had to be rebooted because either the ICE did not work, or the partition would not retract or the seat would not go into a flat position. Eventually my daughter had to move to another seat so she could sleep lying down - after all that is what we paid for. Otherwise, I would recommend Emirates to everyone. The service was excellent with only 40 business class passengers on the outward flight to Dubai, and 30 on the return flight. The flight attendants on the Orlando/Dubai segments both ways were so personable and looked after all the passengers. On the Dubai/Capetown segments they were competent, but aloof. One glitch was the wheelchair in Dubai on return trip - was told it was unnecessary as we would be in transit lounge. Not true. And in Orlando the chair was not visible until I finally just sat in the baggage lounge and said I was not going anywhere. We were fortunate to pay $8,000 for the two of us as a special offer.",8,2015-10-21,United States,False,lure stopover dubai flying orlando cape town strong departed orlando third day inaugural flight business class emirate offer limo pick need wheelchair went smoothly business lounge orlando using small space nice lunch buffet seat b fairly comfortable seat thank goodness addition long pad sleeping remember day delta called chicken airline chicken meal emirate called reboot airline four segment computer rebooted either ice work partition would retract seat would go flat position eventually daughter move another seat could sleep lying paid otherwise would recommend emirate everyone service excellent business class passenger outward flight dubai return flight flight attendant orlando dubai segment way personable looked passenger dubai capetown segment competent aloof one glitch wheelchair dubai return trip told unnecessary would transit lounge true orlando chair visible finally sat baggage lounge said going anywhere fortunate pay two u special offer
"Melbourne to Dubai via Singapore, and the Emirates service was excellent, food superb and flight attendants very attentive. One of my traveling companions had a bad allergic reaction to a product bought at the airport, and the crew went out of their way so much.  After our stopover in Singapore, the new cabin crew had been informed that my companion was not well. They kept an attentive eye throughout the entire flight and when we asked for some chocolate and they forgot because they were so busy, they went to Business Class and got the chocolate from there.

Food was poor, ordered vegetarian and got given 'vegan' on the way out so had to call Emirates to change this for this leg.

"Emirates service was not up to standard. The cabin crew was like newly trained and not professional. I was travelling with wife and one 10 month old son.

My seat was 56J/K. and air hostess always skip these seats which is next to kitchen, and they would start from the seat right behind ours.

"Emirates used to be 10/10 airline but as they secure more routes the service is getting worse. They are often late these days and I now leave at least a 4 hour gap to make sure I make the next flight in Dubai. For the latest flight from Manila to Dubai they forgot that there is heavy traffic on a Friday night and the crew arrived over 2 hours late - if all the passengers can get to the Airport on time then why can't the crew?

"I was able to choose my seats for all four sectors on the round trip. I'm not a big man, so economy seating rarely presents me with a problem, and for me the available legroom was fine regardless of aircraft type. The A380 was a cut above the others in terms of comfort and quietness though, but the service was a little wooden and certainly slow, but the food was not bad at all. Service was slightly better on the DXB-SGN return legs, food reasonable but nothing to write home about. One thing I wish Emirates would move away from is the overcrowded serving tray or at least change the shape of it! A square tray balanced on a rectangular seat table is not a great fit. Entertainment was good, except for the Boeing 777 leg (limited choices and poor picture quality), so slept, read, listened to music on that one. Certainly not the greatest service onboard but adequate; nothing that would stop me flying with them again, certainly for the value for money I get, and the convenience (from my perspective at least) of the flight times. Dubai T3 is another story altogether though; I've flown this route a few times now and it remains the worst part of the journey for me. It's not the two to three hour stop-over, I quite welcome the chance to get out, stretch, wash and change clothes, but the building itself - I find it poorly signposted, and just so busy and bustling I struggle to relax there.

Personally escorted to my Seat 9A by a Vietnamese female flight attendant. I was told I would be looked after by this Cabin attedent throughout my flight and I most certainly was. As I has enjoyed a great breakfast in the Emirates lounge prior to my departure I only had the lite continental breakfast which was pleasant. I have a disability and as my seat was closer to the pointy end of the A380 when I went to use the bathroom I was quietly told I may use the First class facility as First class was empty. Just before landing in Auckland the attendant who had looked after me came and said goodbye then placed a Godiva chocolate with a small hand written note to enjoy my onward travels. Such a personal and special gesture. On arrival a wheelchair awaited me at the aircraft door and 40 min later I was thru customs and on my way to my domestic connection.

We arrived at Gatwick at about 10.30am for a 2.25 pm flight to Brisbane via Dubai and we were told there were no flights till 5 pm or tomorrow. We could board the 2.15 pm flight to Dubai. We were told to go to the National Express (bus) counter and get a bus to Heathrow. The bus arrived about 40 minutes later and we arrived at Heathrow at 1pm at the central bus station. It seemed to be about 1 mile walk to the Emirates check in. No trolleys were allowed on the walk : there were several trolley barriers during the walk.  When we arrived at the Emirates check in we were not in their system. Emirates at Gatwick had forgotten to re ticket us. We had to go to the Emirates counter to get ticketed and then back to check in. We were then the last people to be seated and we could not sit together. When I boarded I was seated next to an enormous man who sat with his legs apart and his arms spread out invading my seat space. My economy Emirates ticket was AUD $2800 which is very expensive. I'd traveled to France in May 2015 and my ticket was AUD $1700. We only got seating to Dubai and our boarding pass from Dubai to Brisbane was marked as standby even though we were picking up our original flight from Dubai to Brisbane. We had to get seating in Dubai and again we were not able to sit together. Again I was seated next to a very large man. I will never travel with Emirates again.

Usually fly Emirates to Singapore as enjoy that it is an evening flight and you arrive in Singapore just before midnight. Check in was easy and headed straight to the Emirates Lounge. One thing I have noticed with the lounge over the years is that it has not been upgraded and service has been degrading for some time know. Food is average at best and the decor was very ordinary when comparing it to the other lounges. Decided not to upgrade onboard as flight was empty and had a whole row to my self. Flight was comfortable and meals adequate but not the best by far and the crew this time were excellent and flight was on time.

"We were looking forward our Emirates experience a lot, since I heard so many things about that company. We flew 4 sectors within 3 weeks with them, and  the check-in on all airports used was smooth and didn't take us long even though we were economy passengers. Aircraft were average, typical Boeing 777 but I could manage to get double seat rows on all sectors, so seating was ok. I was surprised that they really put 10 seats across in a row instead of 9 which many airlines do. Cabin crews were in general nice but realizing that there were so many of them compared to other airlines, the performance was just average. The inflight service on all 4 sectors was a joke, once it took exactly 1hr 47mins before the first bar trolley was pushed out of the galley. On all 4 sectors only one meal was served, not even a sandwich before landing which is quite poor in my opinion. Emirates competitor on flights to Dubai does a lot more with less crew. Duty free was just offered via announcement on one sector only and after the service we never saw a bar trolley again.

"Ground staff at Lisbon we're polite and good natured, but they couldn't for some reason check me for the 2nd leg of my flight from Dubai to Sydney despite trying for sometime, and in the end I told them I'd sort it in Dubai - in hindsight a mistake. The flight was pleasant enough, although as this is Emirates you'll have to endure Arabic subtitles over your movies. I'm not sure why as an international airline they don't offer non subtitled option. Arrived at Dubai and no information about my next flight anywhere. Lined up at Emirates customer service only to be told by a very rude and disinterested customer rep to go to customer service next door and then waved away. Everyone has a bad day so let it go thanked her and went next door. Next customer service rep was the same, told me to catch the train and waved me away. Walked away feeling a little a bit annoyed at Emirates for not being just a little more polite.  I then had to cross security twice in queues to finally get to a Qantas desk. Got there to be greeted by a fairly happy and polite rep who handed me my boarding pass with an upgrade to business.  Excellent, or so I thought - I spent the next 6 hours waiting for the flight, even made arrangements to take my kids first thing in the morning when I land due to being fresh at the other end. Got to the boarding gate in the lounge, made to wait 15 minutes as the rep was late, to be bumped back down to premium economy by a rude Emirates Rep! Didn't properly click what was going on until I got to the door of the aircraft where I approached the Qantas cabin crew. The first girl was disinterested, non-empathetic and in the end I had to walk away from her. In the end I got to talk to a cabin supervisor and after being questioned by one of his peers (insinuating that maybe I'd made up the story) might not have been the intention but perception is reality especially after only a couple of hours sleep. I was told that 3 people were mistakenly upgraded and that the Lisbon Emirates ground staff shouldn't have upgraded me. I briefly explained that they had nothing to do with it.

"This is the second time I flown Emirates Business class to Europe from my home town of Adelaide. The check in was courteous when I asked for my luggage to be tagged as fragile. Boarding was swift. My only complaint at this point in time is the lack of lounge in Adelaide, and we had the share the domestic Qantas lounge which was accessible prior to immigration and custom check. That means that I have very little lounge time. Once boarded the plane, welcome drink was served. Personal introduction by the chief purser of the cabin. Whilst evening meal was offered, we were also offered the option of having breakfast or not being woken up. I chose to have breakfast as it was a long flight of 12 hrs to Dubai.

The seats were comfortable, and better with a soft comforter. The IFE choices were great with latest movies available.

"My wife and I heard a lot about Emirates: new planes, incredible service and even chauffer ride. We decided to try it on our vacation, as there was a nonstop flight JFK to Milan. The van was on time and the fact that the driver farted did not break our high spirits. It was not too hot and an opened widow saved us. At JFK they did not have a separate line for Business class or Global Access and it took us more time than anticipated to get through. The lounge was calm, clean, fresh air, great selection of food and premium drinks. On board we were greeted with Veuve Clicquot and a selection of juices. My wife asked for different juice and it was produced in seconds. The plane looked new with a lot of gadgets. Stewards were very nice and friendly and were only interested in servicing us even better. We were offered a great selection of premium drinks and very good wines. The dinner meals selection was also good, served hot and delicious like at very good Manhattan restaurant. After dinner the beds were made with mattresses and we had a good rest. In the morning, we had a great breakfast. On exit the chauffer was already waiting and the ride to Milan was very nice. All our expectation were exceeded. On the way back there was a separate line for business class and it took us minuets to get to the lounge, where, again, there was a great selection of tasty food and premium drinks waiting for us. A nice touch: the gate was inside the lounge and it took us few steps to get to our seats. I told my wife that I would rather fly Emirates with a layover in Dubai than a direct to Europe with another airline. On the plane we were greeted with a great selection of orange juice only and when I asked for cranberry, had a beaming smile as an answer and stewardess left. Next time we saw her taking drink orders. I asked what Scotch they had, but she did not know what I meant. I asked for whiskey and she offered John Daniels without alternatives. I decided to try something new and was rewarded with Johnny Walker (I think by taste). Contrary to our first experience, to see a stewardess we had to call and wait for awhile and she always came giving the impression that we drew her away from something important. For dinner we had a selection of two wines: red and white and she did not know what a Wine card was. But she promised that her colleague will come to help me which never happened. I can't say speak to food quality, because she brought somebody else's order and I did not have a chance to get mine. No beds. For breakfast I ordered hot beef sandwich which was served deadly cold. When I asked to warm it - beaming smile and it disappeared, forever. We had the imprudence to check my suit in, shortly before the final descent my wife and I asked for it, five times, but tough luck, I got it when all people were clearing the plane and had to change in the airport bathroom. We were out a bit early and did not find our chauffer at the exit area. We waited for about 30 minutes, until I found the Emirates desk where we were told that my ride is waiting for me outside terminal and around the corner. On the way back we left the highway and stopped as chauffer needed to use the bathroom, which, to be honest, was better than farting. We can take any airline anywhere, but we don’t pay a premium for the flight, we pay it for a service.

"Very stressful and unhelpful Emirates ground/check-in service overall on my New York to Dubai trip. Chaotic with the limousine service in New York. Really bad reception in Dubai trying to get a hotel voucher and visa through Emirates ground service. Lady at desk gave me a bunch of papers and asked me to go to the bank around the corner, where the papers were stamped. Then I went back to the first point only to be told that there was no need to return I could go through passport control! Maybe tell that, so people do not have to go back/forth. At JFK check in, I asked about an upgrade to first class. ""Sorry, I do not know how to do that!"" was the reply. Maybe ask someone how? After printing boarding cards I asked her again if she could find out about upgrading (Emirates had an upgrade offer for points on the day). She left and came back saying it could not be done - I suspect because she had already given me the boarding cards. Of course it turned out that there were empty first class seats available on the flight.

"I love the Emirates A380.  I have been flying Emirates since 2010, 2 flights per year and I have to say that this is probably one of the most stressful ones as of yet. I was transiting via Dubai with Emirates and we left Doha quite late and had to literally run to our gate. We had to be escorted by ground staff just for us to make our next flight. I got to the gate and I was probably one of the last few to get on, which was a relief. I go on really short 5-day holidays and my schedule is pretty lean. Not making it to a flight will probably ruin my itinerary a whole lot. Anyway, when I got to the plane, it was quite hectic. DXB-HKG is always mad, I've been flying this route regularly for the past couple of years and it's pretty busy. The staff was not as courteous as before. Seats are standard, but mine would not recline. Not sure if the seat was faulty or the passenger behind me just had really long legs. I have to comment on how the cabin crew looked really exhausted and worn out and we had not even left yet!

"Emirates has a super F-class product. The driver takes you from home to the airport. Check in easy and efficient and you can go to the Emirates lounge in Manchester and a superb one in Dubai. The lounge in Cape town has a fantastic shower but lounge is overcrowded sadly. A380 between Manchester and Dubai is fantastic, an excellent suite with privacy doors. The food is served whenever you want it, whether you want a full meal, snack or a combination. The food is very good, the Meze and caviar were highlights for me. The bar at the back of business is fun. They even bring 2004 Dom to drink. The wine is some of the best in the world, including a sumptious St Emillion. Fun on the A380 is the shower, a proper glass-doored cabinet. You are allowed 5 mins of water, you can switch it off between bursts. The shower room has a heated floor which is magnificent.  Afterwards they offer fresh tea and fruit, all very civilised!  The crew on all the flights were brilliant, though the crew on the way home from Dubai to Manchester just edged it! They were so friendly and helpful. The Boeing 777 from Dubai to Cape Town is a less glamorous aircraft but the service and comfort was top notch.

"We expected a lot from Emirates, but were unfortunately a little disappointed on our flight from Bangkok to Venice via Dubai. The crew on the plane was quite unorganised. The meals were mixed up. We ordered two children’s menus and two special meals and we were lucky enough our meals were not mixed, but our neighbors did not get the special meals they ordered. The staff apologised, however this is not what you would expect from Emirates. Other children on the flight got the toys, but they forgot our children (both 5 years old) and they were very disappointed. Afterwards we had to ask stewardess to please give them something - so later they received the entertainment set. We were quite disappointed with crew services.

"Customer service is really lacking on Emirates. The food in the main cabin was awful, dry and tasteless. The stewards are not very courteous either leaving another bad taste in your mouth. On the flight to Bangkok, I tried to purchase two duty free items but was denied when I produced my driver's license and credit card. According to the steward he could not sell the item to me unless I signed my card. I told him that for safety reasons I do not sign the card and this is a very antiquated rule since the cards now carry a chip. The 3 stewards made quite a scene because I refused to sign my card. After a while I simply asked them to leave me alone and reminded them that this is not a necessity. They all left mumbling to each other. On my return flight from BKK I showed up at the airport with 2 pieces of checked baggage. The staff at the counter told me I was only entitled to one bag and I would have to pay for the other. Of course I said no problem expecting a reasonable price. To my surprise the representative quoted me over 22,000 BHT for the bag. I told her I was only checking an extra bag and not an extra person. She explained that according to my ticket, I have to pay by the kilo per bag.

"When I first travelled Emirates over 5 years ago I could not sing their praises enough. However I have just returned from Munich having one of the worst experiences ever. After moving seats because my entertainment screen did not work, I was seated in one of the two remaining empty seats. I was seated in 48J between two obese travellers and a young woman. As the obese lady needed 1.25 seats it was 12 hours of hell. The food trays were left for an hour which made it impossible to go to the bathroom or move around. Window shades were left open when it was sleep time, when I asked an attendant to request it to be closed I was informed ""sorry the man is asleep"". If a plane is going to be 100% full may I suggest they put on the amount of staff required to service the customers. On the first leg of my journey it was 45 mins before I got a glass of water, I rang the bell but no one replied. I was next to the window and man next to me had all his computer gear (large laptop) because his entertainment system did not work. At the last leg of my journey waiting to use the bathroom for a good ten minutes it was opened by an attendant, who removed the garbage bags so I could use it. Waste was overflowing in the restrooms. The worst was being locked into my seat by food trays, left for what seemed forever. The last experience I had like this was with a Quantas flight to Hong Kong, at least they apologised and explained that they were on staff member down. When are airlines going to realise that economy flyers are their bread and butter and we have a voice.

"I recently flew Emirates from Gatwick to Johannesburg via Dubai return, outward in economy and return in business. The difference is remarkable, in that their economy product is actually much better than business, notwithstanding the extra legroom, flat bed etc. The business product food has become unbearably overcomplicated and plain, and more familiar dishes would be much better. Its almost impossible from the menu descriptions to imagine what you will end up with. The age old problem of Emirates running out of preferred choice continues to be endemic to both classes. Wash bags have been axed on day flights in business class, magazines reduced considerably and the DXB lounge shabby (albeit work is ongoing). Queues for the toilets in the lounge are the norm and poor signposting leaves 10s of travelers lost in a daze. Service standards and crew standards are excellent as is the bottom line standard for Emirates but I can't help thinking that with a bit more focus on the business side, they could be back to where they should be - an industry benchmark.",5,2015-09-27,United Kingdom,False,recently flew emirate gatwick johannesburg via dubai return outward economy return business difference remarkable economy product actually much better business notwithstanding extra legroom flat bed etc business product food become unbearably overcomplicated plain familiar dish would much better almost impossible menu description imagine end age old problem emirate running preferred choice continues endemic class wash bag axed day flight business class magazine reduced considerably dxb lounge shabby albeit work ongoing queue toilet lounge norm poor signposting leaf traveler lost daze service standard crew standard excellent bottom line standard emirate help thinking bit focus business side could back industry benchmark
"Bangkok to Birmingham via Dubai with Emirates. I have been using Emirates for the past 10 years and the service has gone downhill. The positives are a great entertainment system, good prices if the flight is booked at the right time but that's about it. Nowadays the meals have been scaled down and they must be using a cheap supplier as they have gone downhill on the culinary front -  none of the meals that I have had over the past couple of years have been very nice, especially when you compare the economy cabin food of Singapore and Malaysia Airlines both of whom were excellent.

"Dubai to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur with Emirates, and we were pleasantly surprised. The seats (20F/G) were narrow but had decent legroom. Neither of us are tall, but we could have readers and glass cases in the seat pocket and not be bothered. The entertainment system is great : lots of choice and I do like watching the forward looking camera on take-off and landing. The food was good too. Problems are that seats are very narrow, so bumped the neighbour when eating, the food tray is huge - everything comes at the same time, so there is no room on the tray table for wine bottle or discarded containers.

"I was excited to be flying Emirates A380 business class for the first time. Chauffeur service top notch. Seats well-designed, but the film choice was poor. The onboard service was appalling. The problem being that there are so many people in business class in the upper deck of the 380 that the logistics of meal and drinks service go up the creek. Added to which the stewards/stewardesses act like automatons with no common sense and often poor or no English. One example of cock-eyed service is that my wife and I were sitting next to each other but service came from different aisles so she might be waiting patiently for her soup while I am waiting (less patiently) for my pudding. And her wine steward wasn’t permitted to fill up my glass and my aisle wine dispenser appeared 40 minutes later. Seemingly the only way to beat the system is to go to the bar at the back of the section but that would have requires all sorts of seat contortions. On a 7 hour evening flight you expect to get some decent sleep but there isn't enough sleep time when the airline's gambit is to stretch out drinks and dinner unendingly.

"Flight from Adelaide to Dubai on 16 August would have to be one of the worst flights I have taken. The cabin crew were disinterested and disorganised. Seats are very uncomfortable and leg room is almost non existent. The food was the worst food I have encountered on an airline.

They came around twice to offer a cup of water and I found that I became very dehydrated. Even though there is a water cooler near the toilets (which I didn't know about at the time) it was almost impossible to get out of my seat as I was in the middle and my companion was asleep.

The seat back TV had lots of films and TV shows to watch. About 2.5 hours prior to landing a hot full breakfast was served. The 10 across seating makes the aisles very narrow, a few airlines using this plane still have 9 seats across. Cabin staff did their job but lacked smiles and any form of friendliness.

I saw one passenger with a small wheelie suitcase, two bags of duty free, a backpack and large handbag and she used up two overhead bins. I saw other passengers with similar amounts of hand luggage which is a bit unfair to other passengers.

"Emirates are getting worse. My latest flight started in Beirut. Check-in was horrible, four different lines of people, no one knew which line is what.

The flight took off almost 45 minutes late, the crew was professional and very pleasant, but that is the only thing positive to say about the whole trip. We landed in Dubai far away from the terminal. Emirates is running out of terminals and gates, so they land their planes some where in the massive DXB airport and then herd you in a bus. We actually got stuck inside the plane for another 20 minutes before disembarking to a bus. The bus trip to the terminal took another 25 minutes with frequent stops all over the airport.

"I really want to like Emirates, the whole concept of their strategy is excellent but the execution is another story. The product on 2 flights with 2 very different stories. Check in at HKG was simple, fast and friendly. The A380 was a nice plane with kind and helpful staff. Comfortable plane with decent food out of Hong Kong and kind crew. Only gripe is that I had to wait 30 mins from being served my dinner to then waiting for the drinks trolley on our side - the result left me wanting to eat with wine but in the end had a cold meal with wine, but the wine selection in Economy is pretty good. Flight on a Boeing 777-300 from Dubai to Gatwick was not so nice, weird food as the flight was early morning, and a crew like they could not be bothered excepting one Korean staff. Asking for an eyeshade as the flight departed at 02:30 from 2 crew members got me okay I will get one, to we don’t carry them but I will look - in the end no come came to help or answer and I had no eyeshade. The Boeing 777 was not comfortable, not as bad as I was expecting but a far cry from Korean Air 777-300 I flew a few weeks earlier. The mileage points, after London to Seoul and Hong Kong to London, all I earned was 4400 air points!

"I changed my Emirates flight to a late flight departing Athens at 22.20 and arriving into Dubai at 03.50, because there was First Class offered on this extra service and according to my reservation the aircraft was a Boeing 777LR with closed suites. The morning of my departure I was disappointed to find that the aircraft had been changed to an A330 with only sleeper seats. I have never traveled on an Emirates A330, so I had no idea what the seats would be like. On boarding the aircraft I was horrified to find that the seats were not even angle lie flat seats, in fact the seats could hardly recline more than a business class seat on a domestic route. Whilst I understand that airlines can and do change aircraft types on a route, how Emirates could change from private suites to a seat with limited recline and very small leg rest on an overnight services is beyond what I expect when paying a First Class fare. On top of that whilst there was many empty gates on arrival at DXB we were places on a stand far away from the terminal. Again another sign that Emirates have no consideration for the comfort of their passengers.",9,2015-09-14,Australia,False,changed emirate flight late flight departing athens arriving dubai first class offered extra service according reservation aircraft boeing lr closed suite morning departure disappointed find aircraft changed sleeper seat never traveled emirate idea seat would like boarding aircraft horrified find seat even angle lie flat seat fact seat could hardly recline business class seat domestic route whilst understand airline change aircraft type route emirate could change private suite seat limited recline small leg rest overnight service beyond expect paying first class fare top whilst many empty gate arrival dxb place stand far away terminal another sign emirate consideration comfort passenger
"Amsterdam-Dubai-Bangkok with Emirates. A380 airplanes are impressive, although the services at both the airport and onboard flights leave room for improvement.

"Out of Budapest and Warsaw Emirates have very old A330-200 planes which should have been retired years ago. In business class the AV system is old and the seats are not lie-flat and quite uncomfortable. I'm 6ft 2ins tall and my feet don't rest on the ground when I'm sitting in the seat. It's quite tough to sleep in these seats. In Dubai Emirates park the aircraft for these routes at the outer reaches of the airport, so a 20-25 minute bus ride from the terminal to the plane is normal when arriving and departing from Dubai. The last time I travelled they loaded the business class passengers on the bus after all the economy passengers had left. The ground staff then left us sitting with open doors in the bus terminal for about 15 minutes next to three other buses, all of which had their engines running while they waited for the last business passengers to arrive. Despite all of this, the onboard staff are lovely, and on this route they have apologised about the plane. Emirates seems to be operating a penny pinching service to Central Europe but advertising it on the basis that it's the same standard as the rest of the network. Overall if you can get a budget price for this route then it it may be worthwhile, but if you can avoid paying a premium to fly on these Emirates routes as you will be disappointed.",2,2015-09-07,United Arab Emirates,False,budapest warsaw emirate old plane retired year ago business class av system old seat lie flat quite uncomfortable ft in tall foot rest ground sitting seat quite tough sleep seat dubai emirate park aircraft route outer reach airport minute bus ride terminal plane normal arriving departing dubai last time travelled loaded business class passenger bus economy passenger left ground staff left u sitting open door bus terminal minute next three bus engine running waited last business passenger arrive despite onboard staff lovely route apologised plane emirate seems operating penny pinching service central europe advertising basis standard rest network overall get budget price route may worthwhile avoid paying premium fly emirate route disappointed

"I first traveled with Emirates in March 2015 with my 10 year old son to Dubai. The Business Class service was appalling. The crew strutted around, barely taking orders and being completely inept. They served my son the wrong meal and did nothing to make him feel comfortable. They ended up losing my luggage on arrival, such that I was left with no clothes for the first 24 hours. I decided to give them a second chance and this time all 4 of us, (including my 10 year old and 5 year old), flew from NYC to Dubai and on to Bombay in mid August returning 3 days ago. Once again, the service on board was completely disorganized. On boarding, my 5 year old son's seatbelt had dried food all over it. I asked the steward to clean it and he handed me a warm towel and told me to do it myself. When I asked for my dessert to be given to my 5 year old instead of listening to me the stewardess said, ""You only get oreo cookies as dessert with a child's ""economy"" meal"".

"It's such a shame for the incompetence of their ground staff in johannesburg. I've never seen such shambles in my life. We were flying with our two 8 month old twins and 10 year old son. When we got to Johannesburg airport we already done online check in so just went to check out bags in. We waited right in front of the queue for a half hour because staff didn't know what they were doing then finally we got helped, it took the women another half hour to just check our bags in then she got all worried then told us she made a massive mistake, she put the previous passengers name tags on our bags so she had to change all the name tags. However, 2 bags were already sent down so she said she will go and change those tags. We quickly went to say goodbye to family and rushed through because we were running late due to the bag situation. While standing in the queue for ages at passport control one of the staff came and shouted at us because we holding the flight up I explained to her it was due to their incompetence we were late not ours - she rudely rushed us to the gate and saying one of our bags is at suspicious bags because there's a toy gun or aerosol can in it - neither of those items in it. When we got to the gate 15 mins before departure we were rudely spoken to by the other staff saying that we were kicked off. One of the staff members walked us to get our bags and out of departures lounge to rebook our flight. Then they realise that they put our tags on someone else's bags so two of our bags was missing, and other passengers wouldn't have their bags either. After 3 hrs of trying to locate our bags they finally decided that they think that our bags were on the flight to London. When rebooking our flight for the next day, they wanted to charge us an extra £500 per adult even though it was their fault we missed our flight. After speaking to the supervisor she said the only thing she can do to help us is only charging us a no show fee that was still £160. The next day got to the airport they said they've got us on the stand by 13:50 flight to Dubai so we will have 9 hrs transit in Dubai. When we got to Dubai we had to get our boarding passes for the next flight only to realise then that the staff at Johannesburg decided not to book our 2 infants on the next flight - luckily the staff at Dubai was helpful and helped us to book them on to the flight.

It's the whole experience from check in at Sydney (the agent was very grumpy about my baggage being 4kgs over and did not like being told that as a Qantas FF I was well within my allowance) to onboard where the crew were nice but just lacked polish. It's a case of Emirates having expanded so swiftly that their staffing standards are haphazard.

"We left Heathrow at 10.15pm, due to arrive in Dubai around 8am, so this is an overnight flight as I see it.

Emirates is a really good airline for flying with children. But overall I was underwhelmed with the service - indeed it seems to be getting worse each time I fly this airline. Food delivery is a bit erratic in terms of timing, and the steward serving hot drinks passed us by twice. Going to Auckland it was announced we were descending. We hadn't received NZ arrival cards, which are rather long to fill out, so I asked a passing steward. He seemed surprised by the request and I pointed out that everyone else would need one too. So a few minutes later he came round with some - but nowhere near enough for everyone so he had to go back and get some more. Then they got grumpy with us for having a tray table down (to fill it out) while we were in descent. This was really poor - surely handing out landing cards is a pretty basic function - they were handed out straight away going to Melbourne. We had breakfast twice - just before landing in Melbourne and again after taking off and it was pretty much the same both times. Bad luck if you don't like mushrooms or baked beans.

"London Heathrow to DXB in Business Class on the A380. If business class was purely about the comfort of seating and the layout I would give Emirates 10/10. However, I witnessed a very different picture then to my expectations. Having flown Qatar airways throughout the years even on a Bahrain to Dubai flight via Doha, I was accustomed to high standards of service. The service from the crew was a letdown. I asked for a fruit platter and I was told by the crew that they would have to check whether they even have it available. I mean ridiculous that you would not have this to be served to a passenger twice. Frustrating was the fact that the crew did not even come back to tell me through out the whole flight that they did not have fruit plate available, which I think he assumed I forgot. Each and every time I requested something I had to typically wait longer then a passenger flying economy.  I even did not garner a response from the crew that they were unable to carter to my request or an apology for the same. The food itself was not up to the exquisite taste we come to associate with this travel. Obviously I would not know better because I was not able to try another statement dish.

Our flight from Bangkok to Dubai was on the newer A380 and was half empty in Business class. The seat is very comfortable and the crew provided us with a mattress to make it even better for sleeping. There is plenty of storage and the bar next to the seat is a nice touch. The main bar at the back of the upper floor is great idea for socializing. Flight from Dubai to LHR was on the older A380 and it was showing its age. The seat was not as nice and quite dirty in some parts. The crew were friendly and selection of drinks was great.

"I have flown with Emirate a number of times over the last few years, the latest being in April 2015. In many ways they are a good airline, but for vegetarians they are absolutely appalling. Despite always ticking the box for vegetarian lactose (ie. including dairy products) I am only ever served vegan food. This is extremely unsatisfactory because I am not a vegan. At breakfast time when everyone else is eating a nice cheese omelette with hash browns and mushrooms, I am given some horrendous dish of tasteless potatoes.

"The cabin on the new Airbus is lovely. Comfortable bar and lounge area, excellent seats with your own personal mini-bar. On these facilities I have no complaints. My disappointment on my four flights were customer service or the lack thereof, and I am afraid the ultimate criticism - it was no different to being in Economy. On each flight amenity bags were quickly distributed to men, despite waiting patiently I always had to ask. On an 8 hour evening flight I was told, ""we don't hand these out on evening flights."" The menu invites you to choose what tea or coffee you would like. But in reality there is no choice, just like in Economy two stewards come around with flasks of tea and coffee. Tray table is pulled out on the hour, breakfast arrives 20 mins later, coffee follows after 10 mins, and the refill never came. Within the cabin depending on which side your seat was on you visibly had a different experience. I could see post take off drinks being served, but I was never offered one. It becomes tiring to keep buzzing them to receive a minimum service. I have often mocked the likes of Virgin for their automated approach to customer service - but at least you all receive the same service, it is not the luck of the draw. They are inefficient, unorganised, rude, and left me in no doubt that I will never travel Emirates Business Class again.",5,2015-08-10,United Kingdom,False,cabin new airbus lovely comfortable bar lounge area excellent seat personal mini bar facility complaint disappointment four flight customer service lack thereof afraid ultimate criticism different economy flight amenity bag quickly distributed men despite waiting patiently always ask hour evening flight told hand evening flight menu invite choose tea coffee would like reality choice like economy two steward come around flask tea coffee tray table pulled hour breakfast arrives min later coffee follows min refill never came within cabin depending side seat visibly different experience could see post take drink served never offered one becomes tiring keep buzzing receive minimum service often mocked like virgin automated approach customer service least receive service luck draw inefficient unorganised rude left doubt never travel emirate business class
"Emirates is not your ordinary airline, in that it has one of the most extravagantly decorated cabins, from the LED stars to the fancy bathrooms to how their IFE works. It's also worth noting that they seem to fly the plane at maximum operating speeds at all times. It's a nice thought that we matter more than fuel savings. Food was great, seats weren't superb, and cabin service was satisfactory. Being a frequent flyer on Cathay Pacific, I can say that they provide far better service in terms of the cabin crew and frequency of meals. IFE had a very wide suggestion, and worked very smoothly, it's nice of them to leave a volume setting button on the remote even when announcements are being made. Unfortunately Emirates really falls short on seat comfort. I love the 777, it's great, but a 3-4-3 seat configuration is not. The seats felt narrow and sort of claustrophobic.

"I flew Emirates for my first time recently. Having read reviews talking about how great they are and reviews about how cramped their 777 is, I was sceptical. My flight was quite cheap to book ($~650USD). Be warned however, that if you are not flying to or from the US, luggage rules are stricter. If you fly to/from the US, you receive 2 x 20kg bags, otherwise, it is 30kg total. This forced me to spend $350USD on an extra 5kg of luggage, which was quite a hassle. Despite the availability of business class seats, you can only upgrade with points, not cash. The flight was fine, the flight attendants are very sweet and helpful, and the food was some of the best I've had. However - food and drink service takes at least an hour to be delivered, leaving many people finishing their meals before receiving a drink. The seat was pretty standard, I had an empty one next to me, which helped. An inch in each direction would be great. Emirates saved money on the 777 by fitting 10 seats across instead of the usual 9, this leaves very small walkways, and tightens the seats up a bit. However, I'm 6'3"" and didn't have too much trouble. Just be aware, the seats aren't anything to write home about. The ICE entertainment system was good, but a bit jumpy and laggy. Otherwise, ok selection of movies. Unfortunately, my flight didn't have WiFi installed yet. Lastly, the scheduling of the flights seems silly, the Dubai airport is flooded with people at midnight.

"I have become a loyal Emirates traveller over the past year with short hops in and out of Saudi Arabia on a regular basis and retained Gold status. However, this flight reminded me why I do not rate Emirates for longer haul. Flight was a hour late leaving due to slow loading of cargo and then we missed our take off slot. Drink service came 1.5 hours after take off and food started 1 hour later - but took nearly 1.5 hours to get out all courses. By this time we were 2/3rds of the way into the flight (so if we had wanted to sleep forget it) and by Dubai time (my starting point) it was gone 4pm. Food was a starter of tiny piece of smoked duck, mains were something with rice and since there were a lot on non-Chinese on the flight I think in business class there should have been another non-rice choice. My main was two tiny bits of skin covered in tasteless red gunge which was supposed to be sweet and sour chicken plus something that once may have have been pak choi but was so waterlogged it clearly had drowned weeks ago. Totally inedible. About an hour later they offered us a snack - it was barely an hour since lunch - it all smelled awful and what I saw of it was not worth touching.

"Flight from Cape Town was late into Dubai due to traffic parked at a different terminal to the connecting flight but at a remote spot.

At least 20 on the arriving flight had to run for their lives to get to our gate on time. Was exhausted and not even a minute to have a drink in the lounge. The A380 great after the 777. At Heathrow waited an hour at the carousel for the luggage. No help from any Emirates staff only one bag out of three had been loaded in Dubai. They should have sent someone to the baggage reclaim to advise as there were quite a few people who had no baggage. When we got through immigration the Emirates car had left us stranded. On the return the Dubai leg was good but a repeat of the first leg the Cape Town flight parked miles away from terminal 3 and boarding was total chaos.

"The Emirates 777 is a disappointment compared to it's A380 services. The interior was somewhat dated and tired and the entertainment system was not intuitive for the first time user and difficult to navigate once the general layout became obvious. The programs available were generally sufficient. Emirates looks after the kids well, with our youngest receiving special attention when she got on board and the gift she received was far more imaginative than the usual set of crayons and a colouring book that most airlines go for. The kids meals was also a dedicated meal rather than an adult meal with a few tweaks, though it would be nice to see some healthier options available for kids meals. The headset provided actually fit our daughter. It's these small touches that make travelling with kids easier. The seats were roomy in width and pitch and the flight to FRA was only a third full so we had plenty of room to spread out.

"We were disappointed with our recent Emirates flight. On our return from Paris were were informed of a 6 hour delay but without any explanation. During the delay were were provided with a voucher for one drink and one cake! When we eventually boarded it took over two hours to get a meal let alone a drink. My partner was on a special diet and his meal was put in front of him 90 minutes before mine. 4 hours later he still had the tray in front of him. When the food does arrive it's sub standard with yet another annoying snack box containing hard breads and a sweet sticky chilli sauce.

"We are an Australian family of four, that just returned after spending a month in Europe. We booked our travel with Emirates, travelling Brisbane, Barcelona, Paris, London, Dubai and return. The preference for our seating was booked by our travel agent for the window seats in the left rear from rows 46-49. However, on every sector except from London to Dubai, the seats were changed in every instance to those in the middle - four of us! I telephoned the booking offices at each location, who refused to help, then at the check in counter at each airport who were very unhelpful. It was a long journey which we had to endure. I found almost all of their staff, be it Cabin Crew or Counter Staff to be very robotic in their attitude. No customer service at all. No friendly disposition, no making eye contact and overall they all looked very tired. The food provided on the aircraft was more than ample. However, this is not enough to sway me to fly with them again. I did the right thing, booked our trip with them months in advance of our travel, preference of seats and very disappointed at their lack of empathy that we were travelling long distances and no courtesy in endeavouring to help.

The food was great, the staff were helpful. There was a huge selection of free movies and music to watch and listen to during my flight. I also happened to leave my handbag on the plane on my way to Milan and I was sure that I wouldn't get it back, but as I was checking in my luggage, a flight attendant approached me with my handbag, asking if it was mine.

"This was without question the worst Business Class flight I've ever undertaken in my life. Flight was QF8765 a code-shared flight operated by Emirates on 28 June 2015. Flying with Emirates can be a hit or miss affair based on our experiences, with the inflight service either being excellent or completely sub-standard. In this case it was the worst flight ever in terms of customer service, meals availability, and in-flight entertainment not functioning. Our flight attendant was just outrightly rude and lazy, with almost every request being met with an exasperated expression and blunt responses. It honestly felt like we were an inconvenience just being on her plane. This terrible service being followed by incomplete catering. We were offered only one meal from the menu, and there was no desserts, coffee or chocolates. The catering was terrible on this flight, however no apologies from our awful flight attendant. I had to argue with the flight attendant when she attempted to serve my teenage son with a children's meal (despite him being adult sized and holding a full adult Business class ticket). Inflight entertainment was not functioning correctly with mine and several other screens not working. We reported it to our disinterested flight attendant who said they would reset the system, however this never occurred. Upon leaving the aircraft at Sydney I reported the incidents to an Emirates ground staff CSO who was on the aero bridge. We never heard from him or had any follow-up from Emirates at Sydney. We wrote to Emirates, however with any correspondence to the complaints / complements team at Emirates there was no reply.",5,2015-07-10,Australia,False,without question worst business class flight ever undertaken life flight qf code shared flight operated emirate june flying emirate hit miss affair based experience inflight service either excellent completely sub standard case worst flight ever term customer service meal availability flight entertainment functioning flight attendant outrightly rude lazy almost every request met exasperated expression blunt response honestly felt like inconvenience plane terrible service followed incomplete catering offered one meal menu dessert coffee chocolate catering terrible flight however apology awful flight attendant argue flight attendant attempted serve teenage son child meal despite adult sized holding full adult business class ticket inflight entertainment functioning correctly mine several screen working reported disinterested flight attendant said would reset system however never occurred upon leaving aircraft sydney reported incident emirate ground staff cso aero bridge never heard follow emirate sydney wrote emirate however correspondence complaint complement team emirate reply
"Delayed by 10 hrs found out accidentally after check-in when I noticed the boarding pass of the connecting flight showing 19.50 instead of 09.50 (initially thought it was a misprint). No active QF communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to Dubai for 10 hours. Later I found out passengers booked under EK flight numbers were reshuffled to other EK connecting flights, passengers under Qantas had to see the QF counter in Dubai (see below). Flight service was extremely poor from FRA to Dubai, took 3 hrs to finish service, whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes (usually they do this instantly). Drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after, EK service has gone dramatically downhill. On arrival in Dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. It took 20 minutes in a barely air-conditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. Once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. Some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and I doubt they made it. Trying to find a QF counter at Dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. It took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. Some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. Another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop, just missed a shuttle to the express hotel - next one was only 30 minutes later. So from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.5-3 hrs and I walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. After 6 hrs or so I tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. At the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight, although it did not matter as another delay. Service on the Dubai–Sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately, i.e. cutlery one pass, tablet, main meal, desert and drinks – wonder who came up with that stupid idea? This whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak English well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a Qantas counter – they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. Singapore on the same airline is.",1,2015-07-10,Australia,False,delayed hr found accidentally check noticed boarding pas connecting flight showing instead initially thought misprint active qf communication got email mobile number earth delay flight dubai hour later found passenger booked ek flight number reshuffled ek connecting flight passenger qantas see qf counter dubai see flight service extremely poor fra dubai took hr finish service whole seat row forgotten service could fix minute usually instantly drink delivered meal well ek service gone dramatically downhill arrival dubai plane parked roll field longest air field tour ever took minute barely air conditioned bus degree outside temperature arrive building reached big queue incoming security check passenger tight connection got nervous doubt made trying find qf counter dubai airport nightmare maze airport indeed amazing took get right concourse stop info counter relevant sign exist people told took hr get touchdown another minute find right exit shuttle stop missed shuttle express hotel next one minute later touchdown arriving hotel nearby took hr walked short km including extra step trying find counter way hr tried make way shuttle long queue enough seat full push hotel organise quicker return group waiting also time flight pulled forward minute relying boarding pas time printed boarding pas tight although matter another delay service dubai sydney sector good apart annoying new approach service everything given separately e cutlery one pas tablet main meal desert drink wonder came stupid idea whole experience quite amazing make realise tricky thing get thinking passenger able easily walk km speak english well enough follow maze instruction even get qantas counter would chance make realise easy connecting flight e g singapore airline
"WAW to TPE and back. Journey was pretty good. I was little bit upset about DXB airport terminal 3. Maybe it was modern and clean, however ""duty free"" prices had nothing in common with ""duty free"". Good thing is that Emirates provides a free-meal coupon if stopover lasts more then few hours. During all flights the crew was very kind and professional, I was satisfied with their service. Meals were above average. Only one thing really suprised me  was the entertainment system in A330 flying DXB to WAW. Emirates is really proud of its system, but in that plane there were just few channels to choose instead of whole system. Moreover, quality of monitors was far from good. Very surprising.

Twenty minutes later after nothing had happenedI told another hostess who said exactly the same thing. Neither returned to check if the screen was working.

I don’t think the quality of their entertainment consoles are that good, something I have noticed on other flights with them. This experience confirmed that. The seat pitch seems particularly narrow.

"Bangkok to Dubai, 4 July, EK373, A380 was as expected and as usual there was a good offering of inflight entertainment choices. The inflight service was some of the worst I have experienced and my expectations are pretty low! Nearly 2.5 hours until even a glass of water was offered. I would rather they ditched the hot towels and handed out a bottle of water at the beginning of the flight if they are incapable of providing a glass of water within a hour of take off. Crew were largely invisible and on the odd occasion one would scurry down the aisle avoiding all eye contact with passengers. The only visible crew member spent most the flight speaking to friends or family in row 45.

Flights on time. For dinner the last meal available had something that I was intolerant of. They managed to find me a crew meal that saved the day. What was strange was the timing of the meals. Dinner was served about 5pm departure time. Breakfast was about 5am departure time. My guess that this enabled the service of a snack and a light meal on the 6 and 10 hours sectors. Personally i'd rather have dinner at 7 on the short sector. Breakfast much later on the long sector to try to get a sleep.

"After several Economy and Business flights on Emirates we'd accrued enough Skywards points to upgrade our return flight to First class. Emirates First class on the A380 is excellent, you get your own private cabin with closing doors. The seat is massive and very comfortable. There's a tablet remote control so you can adjust your seat into any position or lie-flat and control the TV etc. The cabin is well designed with lots of flat surfaces and a big pull out table/desk. There's a mattress and pillow behind your seat and you are bombarded with free gifts from Bvlgari, pyjamas, slippers, writing kit etc. The cabin manager will greet you and explain how to operate all the toys in your cabin and as the cabin wasn't full we virtually had our own hostess who appeared from nowhere every time you opened you doors. The food is excellent and served to order with plenty of well aged spirits, Dom Perignon, wines and soft drinks. This cabin doesn't have toilet cubicles it has bathrooms with a shower! There's also a self service bar near the bathrooms or you can use the bar at the rear of Business class.

"I have flown Emirates many times and the experience depends on how full and/or the attitude of the crew. This flight was excellent as it was only half full and I had a whole row of 4 seats to myself. The seats in economy are arranged 3-4-3 and quite comfortable, there was no one behind so I could recline my seat. ICE entertainment was very good but not the latest version as on the A380. The food was OK and they were generous with the drinks making several runs with the trollies during the flight and picking up litter. Unfortunately this is not always the case with Emirates, I've been on full flights with bad crew who are stingy with the drinks, slow with the food then leave your tray for 2 hours so you can't leave your seat, all deliberate tactics because they can't be bothered to deal with a full flight, over 300 people.",9,2015-07-07,United Kingdom,False,flown emirate many time experience depends full attitude crew flight excellent half full whole row seat seat economy arranged quite comfortable one behind could recline seat ice entertainment good latest version food ok generous drink making several run trollies flight picking litter unfortunately always case emirate full flight bad crew stingy drink slow food leave tray hour leave seat deliberate tactic bothered deal full flight people
"BRU-DXB on Boeing 777-300 in Business class. The check in was good,  and you get a fast pass through security and passports. They share a lounge with other airlines but it was ok with nice views over the runway. The flight was good with good service from the attentive staff who knew our names and occasionally stopped to chat. The food choices were good, good Moet champagne and a lot of drinks options with good aged spirits. The seats are is 2-3-2 and we always try to prebook 2 together by the window. ICE entertainment system is excellent, probably the best in the air, and very good noise cancelling headphones. The seat is comfortable with a perfect preset recline position but you can adjust it how you want or lie-flat. They provide a mattress if you want to sleep. DXB-BKK on the A380. The Business cabin is nearly all the top deck apart from 3 rows of First in the front. The seat arrangement is staggered so if you want to sit together your only choice is in the middle so you won't get a window seat. However these seats are surrounded by furniture so you're away from the aisle so very cosy. The service was excellent and the staff seemed happy to serve. The seat is different but just as comfortable and of course lie-flat. It has the same ICE system. However the beauty of the A380 is the bar or inflight lounge with it's long, comfy seats and plenty of standing area.

"This was my first flight on the new Emirates A380. We flew Heathrow to Dubai in economy class (then on 777 to Delhi). I've flown on Emirates 777 in economy many times which is probably the best but on the A380 it's another level. My son and I sat in the back row of 4 seats in the front section, the flight wasn't full so we had all 4 seats to ourselves, a bonus. However the seats are wider with more leg room than on 777. The ICE entertainment system is excellent with over 100 movies for a 7 hour flight and the screen is big. The headphones are ok but I recommend taking your own to block out all noise. The service was excellent, maybe because it wasn't a full flight, and the food was good and they were quick with the drinks and made several drinks run throughout the flight. The next leg to Delhi was a 777 so I prebooked the 2 seats together at the back of the plane but when we went to the gate to board we were upgraded to business class, probably because the flight was full or overbooked but another welcome bonus.

"While I did get my value for money, I wouldn't consider flying Emirates again. Ground service at Sydney airport was ok. Check-in was quick and smooth. However, at the gate staff were generally unfriendly and quick to dismiss people. The person managing the gate seemed tired and angry at customers. The plane was clean and quite spacious. The seats were comfortable and the inflight entertainment was very good. There was a very large selection of entertainment. However, the flight was significantly let down by the crew. When boarding, the flight attendant at the door sent me down the wrong aisle. When serving the hot towels, the flight attendant literally threw a towel at me.

Not only do they have a plethora of TV series but they have entire seasons. My biggest gripe about Emirates is the inconsistent service. Some of the flight attendants are wonderful but most of them on this flight were rude and unfriendly. Service was extremely slow and call bells were ignored. They had very terrible attitudes which is appalling. For example, during the breakfast service, a croissant was thrown at my tray because the flight attendant was simply too lazy to lean over a bit. Trays were also left in our tables for over two hours and when I tried to go to the galley and personally put it in the cart, I was met with a shrugged look. Catering was a disappointment and options easily ran out and were unimaginative, not what it used to be. DXB is also a mess and would try at all cost to avoid.

"I have traveled on Emirates airlines since it's inception in the 1980s when I was a resident of UAE. My husband and I were very excited to become a part of the Emirates airline family once again when the routes to Asia from US were introduced. I flew the SFO to India (Bengaluru) route for the second time in 18 months last month (May) with a stop over in Dubai for 2 days. I received an e-mail confirmation 24 hours prior to my travel time. However, when I arrived with my 7 year old daughter at the airport to check in 2 hours prior to travel time, I was informed that our seats had been given away. I had even requested and reserved specific seats for our family 2 months prior to the travel date over the phone with an Emirates customer service representative. We had to wait 30 minutes and were then given 2 seats to travel to Bengaluru and then were made to rush to the gates to make the flight. I was informed by the agent who was checking me in that my seats were given away because I had not checked in online! I told her that I had received e-mail confirmation just the day of travel, confirming my seats and now I was being told that online check in was necessary to ensure getting seats to travel. Our family travels all the time in several different airlines and have never heard of online check in being required to confirm having seats! We had to deal with this same stress once again upon our return journey from Bengaluru at the Emirates check in counter. This time I had confirmed all our tickets online prior to travel as suggested. However, when we were ready to check in our baggage, we were told that my husband's seat was not available and they could not seat us together. We had to wait for 20 minutes and insist on getting the seats that we had requested and wanting to speak to the supervisor before we were finally given the 3 seats together. Once again, they said that they had to hold our seats as the flight was over booked and full. I fail to understand how this can happen to any passenger traveling on an international flight who had confirmed tickets 2-3 months prior to travel date! We arrived on time as per schedule at the airports both the times to check in luggage and followed standard Universal airlines protocol. There was no apology for all the inconvenience and stress that was caused when we were finally handed our boarding passes. The agents at the counter made it appear as if they were doing us a favor by being able to give us boarding passes and seat us together.

"Flew EK372 from Dubai to Bangkok on the A380. The A380 is a magnificent aircraft! Overall, very impressed with their service this time. Complete opposite to the previous times I've flown with them. The crew were superb, chatty and greeted passengers with welcoming smiles. During the flight they were very attentive and when called there were no grumpy faces! In terms of entertainment, I don't think any airline can beat Emirates' ICE entertainment system. It's fantastic and you'd never get bored with their selection of movies offered on their enormous screens (bigger than your standard iPad!). Loved their on board cameras too. Seats and legroom on the A380 are great - by far better than their cramped 777s! The plane was also only half full so I had 2 spare seats next to me. The food was good although I wasn't very hungry and didn't finish it all but needless to say there was plenty, not to mention the extra snacks offered on board. Emirates also give you real cutlery not plastic ones. Only downside is that toilets got quite dirty and weren't taken care of by the crew (but this of course is also down to careless passengers) and WIFI didn't work properly though with all of the above, you forgot it was even there.

DXB-LAX - June 4th 2015 - The positives: Flight departed and arrived on time complimentary chauffeur reliable pleasant and polite A380 is a great plane to fly in and off course the unbeatable ICE IFE system with large screen in Business very few airlines in the world can beat Emirates on this one. They also have changed their menu on this route a welcome initiative after goodness knows how many years the previous menu has been served on the route. The mediocre part of the trip: Service quality difference between the multinational cabin crew. Some goes the extra call of duty being very accommodating some gives you the impression that they wish to be elsewhere one stewardess was just unpleasant - I do not need to justify my second request for a burger as the serving was minuscule as a mid-flight meal. Mid-flight desert was excellent. Breakfast main sounds appetizing on menu - poached eggs turned up rather disappointing the termed boiled is more appropriate the accompanying Salmon Potato Rosti was soggy rather than crisp. Overall a disappointing plate that is just so far from its description in the menu. Lunch menu prior to arrival on the other hand is excellent. Seared Tuna loin on edamame is a welcome change to the rather boring Arabian meze. Shrimps served with polenta is a welcome option to the permanent features of the menu the plain old steak and Indian inspired dish. Dessert is excellent. Menu on this route still needs to be perfected and I know Emirates can do this judging from quality of meal/wine on board of other route (SYD-DXB).,5,2015-06-07,Saudi Arabia,False,dxb lax june th positive flight departed arrived time complimentary chauffeur reliable pleasant polite great plane fly course unbeatable ice ife system large screen business airline world beat emirate one also changed menu route welcome initiative goodness know many year previous menu served route mediocre part trip service quality difference multinational cabin crew go extra call duty accommodating give impression wish elsewhere one stewardess unpleasant need justify second request burger serving minuscule mid flight meal mid flight desert excellent breakfast main sound appetizing menu poached egg turned rather disappointing termed boiled appropriate accompanying salmon potato rosti soggy rather crisp overall disappointing plate far description menu lunch menu prior arrival hand excellent seared tuna loin edamame welcome change rather boring arabian meze shrimp served polenta welcome option permanent feature menu plain old steak indian inspired dish dessert excellent menu route still need perfected know emirate judging quality meal wine board route syd dxb

Flew to Perth stopping off in Dubai. Not overly impressed with Business Class Lounge in Heathrow a very limited breakfast. Boarded their new A380 and it was fabulous. I thought I was in First Class initially. Very comfortable and spacious seat and huge screen and many up to date films to watch. Very pleasant and efficient cabin crew who dispensed hot flannels (face cloths) regularly. The food was excellent and the bar at the back well words pass me. 18 year old Chivas Regal and top class nibbles (nuts and savoury biscuits). The entire flight was a singular joy and if you are using Emirates do try to upgrade if an A380 is the plane being used. Even the US pilot (he told us) seemed to have a purr of happiness to be flying this wonderful beast. So why the low assessments I hear you asking? Well it started going downhill after disembarking. Had to undergo another bag and body security check (not Emirates fault). Then the nightmare trying to find the gate for the second flight. I was given so much false information. Finally got to check in which was slow and ponderous and another bag and body security check. This time a Boeing 777. Oh! what a difference. It was old tired worn out and uncomfortable. The seat could lie flat but was very narrow preventing changing positions when sleeping. The television screen was significantly smaller too. The cabin crew were very friendly and pleasant and the food was good (just as well I like fish though). The difference between the A380 and the Boeing 777 was astounding.

Much more attentive than the huge long business class on the A380's where crew walk for miles to ferry food and drink. I only marked them down on the seat as it is an older one and same for the inflight entertainment otherwise I would rather fly these older planes than the 380's apart from the bar area of course.,10,2015-05-31,New Zealand,False,flew ek dubai dar e salaam often fly route flying new zealand always prefer older consistently great crew brilliant service food drink much attentive huge long business class crew walk mile ferry food drink marked seat older one inflight entertainment otherwise would rather fly older plane apart bar area course
I travelled from Perth to Dubai on 28/5/2015 and from Dubai to New York on 29/5/2015. I thought the food was excellent and the seats were comfortable. The flight attendants on both flights were nice and friendly. Even though both flights were very long they seemed to go quite quickly.

"Travelled NZ to England 3 flights both ways in May. I think their standards have slipped having flown with them several times now. My main gripe is the miserable cabin crew. Hardly anyone smiles or gives eye contact. The food was ok but quite repetitive. We often didn't get to choose the meal we wanted as ""they had ran out"". It's a pity you can't give an indication of which meal you would choose prior to the flight so they can get more accurate supplies. Meals seemed a bit disorganised and drawn out at times and we couldn't believe that they abandoned the last ""sweet snacks"" round after serving half the cabin. We thought the staff were going to get more supplies or we would be served later but no. We got nothing. Then it was time to land with a 3 hour wait for the next connection so we had to purchase some drinks and snacks in the airport to keep us going. Maybe they left it too late to start the snacks round. But again better organisation is therefore needed. The staff were not seen much in between the food and drinks serving unless somebody called for them. On previous flights they often came round with extra water. But this time hardly at all which left us quite dehydrated as I didn't realise till the end you could self serve from a point on the aircraft. This should have been made known to everyone at the beginning of the flight. We had the Airbus for all of the flights which was a great. The entertainment and leg room were much needed on such long journeys. All in all we are keen to try a different airline next time.",10,2015-05-31,New Zealand,False,avelled nz england flight way may think standard slipped flown several time main gripe miserable cabin crew hardly anyone smile give eye contact food ok quite repetitive often get choose meal wanted ran pity give indication meal would choose prior flight get accurate supply meal seemed bit disorganised drawn time believe abandoned last sweet snack round serving half cabin thought staff going get supply would served later got nothing time land hour wait next connection purchase drink snack airport keep u going maybe left late start snack round better organisation therefore needed staff seen much food drink serving unless somebody called previous flight often came round extra water time hardly left u quite dehydrated realise till end could self serve point aircraft made known everyone beginning flight airbus flight great entertainment leg room much needed long journey keen try different airline next time

The A380 is a jumbo jet however the Emirates seats are very hard. Your legs will get very sore after 2 hours flight in. Food is so so and the cabin crew are mostly unpleasant or just not willing to help.

As an avid Qatar airways traveller I thought it is only fair that I write my thoughts on my recent flight from Manchester UK to Islamabad PK with a 3 day stop over in Dubai with Emirates travelling out on 26/04/15 and returning on 13/05/15. Confession this was the first time I have flown with Emirates and not had a major complaint. Travelled with my Mother and 3 year old Nephew. The flight going from here was fairly full but the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. The Seating was ok food etc was served on time and they were efficient. They had better inflight entertainment compared to Qatar so my nephew was kept occupied. The food served was very nice. Flight from Dubai to Islamabad was very quiet not many people were traveling so they were able to quickly serve and people were able to sleep in more comfort if required. The return flight highlight for me would have to be the A380 from Dubai to Manchester they had more entertainment for the children as well as the adults. Seats were extremely comfortable cabin crew were really sweet especially with my nephew. I have travelled on A380 last year but my experience was not very good. Only complaint on behalf of the older generation would be the amount of confusion that there was once we had got to Dubai airport due to the sheer size a train had to be caught from one terminal to the other there were a lot of people were very confused about this and I cannot really blame them. However based on the overall experience I would definitely travel with them again.,9,2015-05-29,United Kingdom,False,avid qatar airway traveller thought fair write thought recent flight manchester uk islamabad pk day stop dubai emirate travelling returning confession first time flown emirate major complaint travelled mother year old nephew flight going fairly full staff extremely pleasant helpful seating ok food etc served time efficient better inflight entertainment compared qatar nephew kept occupied food served nice flight dubai islamabad quiet many people traveling able quickly serve people able sleep comfort required return flight highlight would dubai manchester entertainment child well adult seat extremely comfortable cabin crew really sweet especially nephew travelled last year experience good complaint behalf older generation would amount confusion got dubai airport due sheer size train caught one terminal lot people confused cannot really blame however based overall experience would definitely travel
Flight EK375 Business Class from Bangkok to Dubai on May 23 2015 on a A380. After viewing all those promotional videos from Emirates I decided to use that airline to fly to Riyadh via Bangkok and must confess that I am somewhat disappointed. The lounge in Bangkok is quite plain and sterile with a very limited choice of food. As to the flight itself seats are not ergonomic: the armrest is very short due to the separation panel between seat and corridor and the table is difficult to pull out if you are very slightly overweight. Emirates is quite stingy with amenities and even socks are taken away at the end of the flight if unused. Service was efficient but it cannot be compared with the one on Etihad where you can wine and dine anytime and where the choice of drinks and the quality of food is far superior to what is offered on Emirates. Flight attendants were relatively indifferent. The bar of course is very nice and that is the best thing on that flight. The cabin decoration is reminiscent of a hospital corridor. All in all a flight without surprise but next time I will go back to the friendly Thai people or to the excellent Etihad performance.,4,2015-05-27,Thailand,False,flight ek business class bangkok dubai may viewing promotional video emirate decided use airline fly riyadh via bangkok must confess somewhat disappointed lounge bangkok quite plain sterile limited choice food flight seat ergonomic armrest short due separation panel seat corridor table difficult pull slightly overweight emirate quite stingy amenity even sock taken away end flight unused service efficient cannot compared one etihad wine dine anytime choice drink quality food far superior offered emirate flight attendant relatively indifferent bar course nice best thing flight cabin decoration reminiscent hospital corridor flight without surprise next time go back friendly thai people excellent etihad performance

BKK-HKG-BKK trip on EK384 and EK385 respectively on April 1st and April 4th. On the outbound leg boarding was at will. Arrived at boarding gate about an hour before the departure time and was told to go ahead and grab our seats inside the plane. The cabin crew appeared to have little or no training in their jobs. They wore dirty shabby uniform. No safety checks or seatbelt checks prior to take off as one would expect from any airline. Rushed safety announcement which was barely understandable. The meal they served resembled a frozen microwavable quick meal. I picked the chicken offering which smelt and tasted horrible. Cabin crew were mostly absent through the entire flight. On our return leg same story with the meal - I didn't even bother to touch it. IFE screen was frozen on my wife's seat and despite promises from a crew to reboot it nothing worked. Headphones for half the passengers in my section were broken as could be seen from passenger complaints onboard. I fly this route at least once a year and do not look forward to flying EK again unless desperate. The A380 is an amazingly comfortable plane to fly however EK service was a massive letdown.,5,2015-05-27,Canada,False,bkk hkg bkk trip ek ek respectively april st april th outbound leg boarding arrived boarding gate hour departure time told go ahead grab seat inside plane cabin crew appeared little training job wore dirty shabby uniform safety check seatbelt check prior take one would expect airline rushed safety announcement barely understandable meal served resembled frozen microwavable quick meal picked chicken offering smelt tasted horrible cabin crew mostly absent entire flight return leg story meal even bother touch ife screen frozen wife seat despite promise crew reboot nothing worked headphone half passenger section broken could seen passenger complaint onboard fly route least year look forward flying ek unless desperate amazingly comfortable plane fly however ek service massive letdown
AMS-DXB-HKG and MEL-DXB-AMS. Overall I was impressed by the aircraft (especially the amount of space in the A380) entertainment and catering. The crew however in my opinion delivered a very inconsistent service along the different flights. In general the welcome during boarding was excellent personal and warm. But then the crew members differed so much that I was puzzled. Some really were excellent did lot's of extras to make you feel a welcome guest. The other half however in my opinion was either rushed tired did not reply to call button at all. No apologies/no sign of human contact were made at all on the long MEL-DXB flight after forgetting two rows on meal service not replying to call button buttons forgetting to hand out drinks ordered. It really was an accumulation of mistakes that can happen but the handling of it made me unhappy. All in all I will fly them again for the comfortable product they offer but I have tempered my expectations for the overall face to face contact during the flights which in my opinion weigh heavily.,9,2015-05-27,Netherlands,False,am dxb hkg mel dxb am overall impressed aircraft especially amount space entertainment catering crew however opinion delivered inconsistent service along different flight general welcome boarding excellent personal warm crew member differed much puzzled really excellent lot extra make feel welcome guest half however opinion either rushed tired reply call button apology sign human contact made long mel dxb flight forgetting two row meal service replying call button button forgetting hand drink ordered really accumulation mistake happen handling made unhappy fly comfortable product offer tempered expectation overall face face contact flight opinion weigh heavily

EK435 Brisbane to Dubai A380. It was a full flight and I did not get the seat I requested however that is not unique to Emirates and the aisle seat I had 87H was ok its drawback was being knocked as people navigated the aisle. The noise from the flushing of the nearby toilets was annoying but after 14 hours and 20 minutes it takes very little to mildly annoy you. I received 3 adequate meals receiving a menu would have been nice and would have avoided much confusion and a protracted meal service as the dishes or lack of was explained to questioning passengers. Being seated at the back of the plane meant no choice of meal as they had run short of one of the options. The cabin crew from 19 countries speaking 17 different languages were young and seemed to lack any cohesion or team work. The meal services were seemingly the most unorganised I have seen but everybody ate in the end. The bar service was poor but that might be expected of this carrier but was available if you were prepared to go looking for it. The staff were not overly helpful and frequently served refreshment throughout the flight the cabin staff were commonly found in the galley areas chatting and seemed to lack some direction and co- ordination. The seat was adequate with better leg room than some carriers a foot rest would have been useful. The inseat TV screens and entertainment system were excellent. The onward flight was equally full - EK161 A330 with a similar review. This time a menu was provided and the bar did arrive in time with the meals. We were airborne without being offered any refreshment for almost 2 hours until the meal service commenced and again this was more disorganised and ad hoc than any other airline I have ever experience but again all were fed and watered. Towards the end of the 7 hour 40 minute flight the toilets were dirty the bins overflowing and toilet paper expended. These seats were less comfortable with less leg room and smaller TV screen. Overall and an average long haul experience slightly better than I expected. I would use again if the price point was enticing.,4,2015-05-25,Australia,False,ek brisbane dubai full flight get seat requested however unique emirate aisle seat h ok drawback knocked people navigated aisle noise flushing nearby toilet annoying hour minute take little mildly annoy received adequate meal receiving menu would nice would avoided much confusion protracted meal service dish lack explained questioning passenger seated back plane meant choice meal run short one option cabin crew country speaking different language young seemed lack cohesion team work meal service seemingly unorganised seen everybody ate end bar service poor might expected carrier available prepared go looking staff overly helpful frequently served refreshment throughout flight cabin staff commonly found galley area chatting seemed lack direction co ordination seat adequate better leg room carrier foot rest would useful inseat tv screen entertainment system excellent onward flight equally full ek similar review time menu provided bar arrive time meal airborne without offered refreshment almost hour meal service commenced disorganised ad hoc airline ever experience fed watered towards end hour minute flight toilet dirty bin overflowing toilet paper expended seat le comfortable le leg room smaller tv screen overall average long haul experience slightly better expected would use price point enticing
Three of us travelled with Emirates leaving Heathrow on 30th April 2015 and returning on 16th May 2015. The trip to Singapore was ok but initially food of choice was not given to us until 30 minutes later they managed to find us the curry mutton. However the complaint I have about the flight is the return trip from Singapore stopover at Dubai to Heathrow. The first leg between Singapore and Dubai was fine. It is flight from Dubai to London on the 16th May 2015 which I am most unhappy about. At the start the flight was late. The air-conditioning was not working under the heat in Dubai. The pilot did inform us of the fault with the air-conditioning but that it would be fine once we were in the air. The flight was delayed 30 minutes and we were not given water from the flight attendants. For that reason I doubt if I will fly with Emirates again.,2,2015-05-25,United Kingdom,False,hree u travelled emirate leaving heathrow th april returning th may trip singapore ok initially food choice given u minute later managed find u curry mutton however complaint flight return trip singapore stopover dubai heathrow first leg singapore dubai fine flight dubai london th may unhappy start flight late air conditioning working heat dubai pilot inform u fault air conditioning would fine air flight delayed minute given water flight attendant reason doubt fly emirate
LGW-DXB-BKK-DXB-LHR. LGW-DXB B777. I had forgotten how bad the Emirates 777 were the decision to have 4 across the middle makes the aircraft feel cramped and the one I used felt in need of a refit. The good selection of movies and TV can be let down with many faults only the left side audio worked in my seat after trying 3 different head sets I gave up and the seat next to me had to be rebooted several times before it would work. All other legs on A380 had the feeling of space and room and after the 777 was excellent but still several cabin issues either with the IFE or the seat not being able to recline fixed by a male member of the cabin crew putting all his weight on it and forcing it back. I sat it up for the meal and it would not go back again so the rest of the flight was spent upright. Meals came at odd times and the drinks came much later than the meals. As for the cabin staff they are a very mixed group so you are never sure of the level of service you will get I went on one flight to ask for a toothbrush and it was met with a look of what do you expect in economy class then the curtain was pulled shut and I was left wondering if there was one or not a minute or so later a hand comes out of the side of the curtain holding 2 toothbrushes.,5,2015-05-22,United Kingdom,False,lgw dxb bkk dxb lhr lgw dxb b forgotten bad emirate decision across middle make aircraft feel cramped one used felt need refit good selection movie tv let many fault left side audio worked seat trying different head set gave seat next rebooted several time would work leg feeling space room excellent still several cabin issue either ife seat able recline fixed male member cabin crew putting weight forcing back sat meal would go back rest flight spent upright meal came odd time drink came much later meal cabin staff mixed group never sure level service get went one flight ask toothbrush met look expect economy class curtain pulled shut left wondering one minute later hand come side curtain holding toothbrush
Manchester (MAN) to Dubai A380 and then on to Christchurch (via BKK and SYD) on B777. Return from Auckland to Dubai (via BNE) and Dubai to Manchester all on A380. My first time with Emirates (lots of KLM/AF in last 5 years) and overall a good experience. A380 seats slightly wider so feel more roomy but what gave most space is that with exception of one leg (BNE to DXB) seat next to me was empty. Food mostly OK (one meal was cold) but Emirates choice of meal and times seems odd. (So 10pm flight out of MAN serves eve meal but no breakfast before landing at 7am local time) next flight leaves 9am local time and then serves lunch almost immediately. On the longer legs I miss the 'help yourself buffet' cart that KLM/AF have in the galley. Cabin crew vary a lot huge range of nationalities means considerable variety in service. In A380 it takes a while to get served so your meal is eaten (or left to go cold) long before you get offered a drink. Inflight entertainment is excellent once you've got used to having adverts at the start! Overall was happy with Emirates but didn't love it. I suspect the reason they were cheapest flights is because they do everything to a tight budget and the economy experience reflects this.,10,2015-05-20,United Kingdom,False,manchester man dubai christchurch via bkk syd b return auckland dubai via bne dubai manchester first time emirate lot klm af last year overall good experience seat slightly wider feel roomy gave space exception one leg bne dxb seat next empty food mostly ok one meal cold emirate choice meal time seems odd pm flight man serf eve meal breakfast landing local time next flight leaf local time serf lunch almost immediately longer leg miss help buffet cart klm af galley cabin crew vary lot huge range nationality mean considerable variety service take get served meal eaten left go cold long get offered drink inflight entertainment excellent got used advert start overall happy emirate love suspect reason cheapest flight everything tight budget economy experience reflects
Flight EK008 from London Heathrow to Dubai 16 April 2015 Business Class. The seat I was assigned 10D did not recline and was broken. The system was rebooted 3-4 times from the shoe holder from the rack alongside the seat from the control area of the aircraft and separately by another to physically try and push it down each one extending for up to 15 minutes and me forced out of the seat for the majority of this period and this went on for about 3.5 hours of the 7 hour flight. Until then I was not moved to any other seat with the rebooting I couldn't use the entertainment options for a couple of hours as well. After the Chief Purser heard about this she immediately took action and moved me to another seat. I was for approximately 2.5 hours of the flight moved to seat 4K on the flight thereafter. The electronic console handset which is connected to the seat did not power on and didn't work. There was water clogging in the shower in the bathroom on the right side of the aircraft. I had a vegetarian oriental meal requested and instead it was an Asian Vegetarian Meal that got loaded. Once again we are now in the 21st century and still Emirates Business Class does not have a single (out of four) main course meal options in the menu which are vegetarian. Often last minute travel options have to be ticketed and this means I will not have any assurance of a vegetarian meal option on Emirates. Seems odd and not befitting an airline such as Emirates which has fantastic infrastructure and options available to it as well as world renowned chefs.

CDG-DXB-KIX NRT-DXB-CDG. A380 / B777-300ER. First time with Emirates with high expectations. In terms of aircraft's themselves not disappointed at all. Great seats (especially on the A380) with space enough to bear long flights and extremely wide selection of entertainment. What disappointed me was first of all the service. In all 4 legs almost all crew members were almost bothered to give service. No smiles at all. When you asked them something basic like a glass of water you almost felt you were bothering them. Another disappointment was food quality and quantity. Continental breakfast from DXB left me hungry for few hours. The rest of meals acceptable but not good as other European Airlines (AF or KLM for example). Overall really not in line with my expectations and not same overall level as other airlines as SQ or QF.

When we were moving towards the runway the plane stopped and after an hour the captain realized there was a technical issue. We were kept onside the plane for 2.5 hours with no food or water. The flight crew were most inconsiderate. It was a madhouse! People were frustrated and angry without any details on what was going on. They finally let us out from the plane into a tiny lounge (at least it had AC). Forget about food or water at this point. 1.5 hours later they boarded the same plane all over again and with total of 4 hours delay we finally took off.

I just used Emirates for the trans-Tasman trip from Auckland to Melbourne so benefited from being in a big plane. It was the first time in many years that I actually enjoyed the trans-Tasman flight. Comfortable seat tasty food (real cutlery!) and polite service. Lots of movies and TV programmes to choose from and you had the option of viewing one of three plane cameras which made it interesting. The only downside was having to return the headphones 20 minutes before landing and I hadn't finished watching the movie. A tip to take your own headphones. I would highly recommend Emirates for Aus/NZ flights.,5,2015-05-18,New Zealand,False,used emirate trans tasman trip auckland melbourne benefited big plane first time many year actually enjoyed trans tasman flight comfortable seat tasty food real cutlery polite service lot movie tv programme choose option viewing one three plane camera made interesting downside return headphone minute landing finished watching movie tip take headphone would highly recommend emirate au nz flight
Flew from Manchester (UK) to Dubai on EK20 and then from Dubai to Christchurch (NZ) on EK419 (this flight stops at Bangkok and Sydney on the way. Returned from Auckland via Brisbane to Dubai on EK 435 and then to Manchester on EK17. EK419 is on a B777 with the remained on A380's. Cabin crew are variable but mostly good I suspect the multinational nature of crews contributes to this variability. The connection time in Dubai for the outward leg was 90 mins but there was someone at the gate who met me and other transfer passengers with shorter connections and escorted us to transfer buses. On most legs the food was reasonable (except for the hot meal from Auckland which was nearly cold by the time I got it) though the decisions about when and what to serve seem bizarre. For example the flight leaving at 7:30am served lunch 2 hours into flight and on the return I got two evening meals served 3 hours apart. Unlike KLM/AF who I've flown with lots in last 5 years there is not a self service buffet mid flight on the long haul legs. Entertainment system is excellent though it's unusual to have adverts on aircraft. Seats were OK a bit wider on A380.

I couldn't get out of it fast enough. The terminal was painful particularly the gate area. Once on board not overly impressed with the seat. Crummy selection of newspapers. I was chatting with my seatmate but the privacy divider would not retract which made conversing awkward.

I travelled from Heathrow to Dubai and then onto Singapore. On my return it was from Tokyo to Dubai and then onto Heathrow. As far as I am concerned it has been the best airline that I have travelled with. Seating and leg room was more than enough (I'm 6 foot). The food was adequate but how many breakfasts and lunches can you eat? Mine was a total of 8. One consideration which I was very pleased with is the fact that I am asthmatic and every time without exception I have ended up with a cold or infection. Not this time on all of the above flights.

I have not taken an international flight for many years but before then I travelled overseas all the time often with 2 small children (by myself). This trip I flew Sydney - Dubai - Dublin for Christmas 2014. Then returned Manchester - Dubai - Sydney in Jan 2015. I found on all flights that the cabin crew were fighting amongst themselves and were not interested in the passengers at all. I felt that it was an imposition to ask for anything. I went to the galley and asked for something to eat when most were sleeping and was told that food would be coming soon. It came 2 hours later. The cabin crew were sitting/drinking/eating and arguing. The meal thing surprised me as I had never been hungry on an international flight before. We were fed twice in 14 hours.

I flew PRG-PER and SYD-PRG both through DXB and was satisfied. The staff was friendly and helpful seats comfortable and spacious enough the planes (B777 on all legs except for SYD-DXB which was on the A380) were (or at least seemed) new and the vegetarian meal was surprisingly tasty. Both of the flights between Dubai and Australia were only half-full making it much easier to sleep. The only hiccup along the way was high traffic at the Dubai airport due to which we had to stay in the air for an additional 30 minutes. I also had to re-book my second flight (the charge for this is 99 euro) which I did over the phone in about ten minutes and without any problems.

I flew with my wife and 3 year old son from Auckland to Dubai via Brisbane and then a few days later onto London all on A380s. Our son was given a pack with a book and activities as well as a blanket and toy on all the legs. On the way to Brisbane it took an hour before any refreshments were offered. Interestingly going to Dubai they didn't provide him with a child's meal claiming we had to order it in advance (but surely they can see on the passenger manifest he is a child?) We asked our stewardess on the first leg if she could find one. She said she'd be back in a couple of minutes and we never saw her again. We asked someone else to see if they could organise one for going on to Dubai and same again. On the way to Dubai the lights were left on way too long. Yet when we went to London our son was given a child's meal straight away and the overall level of service was very good. The meals we got were very good although the breakfast frittata was a bit overdone. No complaints about the superb entertainment options though. So same airline for two flights but two quite different levels of service.,9,2015-05-01,New Zealand,False,flew wife year old son auckland dubai via brisbane day later onto london son given pack book activity well blanket toy leg way brisbane took hour refreshment offered interestingly going dubai provide child meal claiming order advance surely see passenger manifest child asked stewardess first leg could find one said back couple minute never saw asked someone else see could organise one going dubai way dubai light left way long yet went london son given child meal straight away overall level service good meal got good although breakfast frittata bit overdone complaint superb entertainment option though airline two flight two quite different level service
I flew on 21st April 2015 from Bangkok to London I had my baby with me and was feeling very nervous about flying with her but the staff were so friendly and helpful. When my baby cried they helped me calm her down especially one staff member who saved my sanity he even made me an iced coffee with out me asking. The second flight was not as great as I felt the staff weren't as friendly and welcoming I had the assistance light on for over an hour and no one came and when I tried to wave someone down they would just ignore me. You could also hear a few of them moaning about being tired and hungry which I don't think is very professional. The main thing I would say that was bad was at the baggage claim when the buggy's were the last items to be put round the belt so there was a lot of tired babies and parents waiting for their buggies.,8,2015-04-28,United Kingdom,False,flew st april bangkok london baby feeling nervous flying staff friendly helpful baby cried helped calm especially one staff member saved sanity even made iced coffee asking second flight great felt staff friendly welcoming assistance light hour one came tried wave someone would ignore could also hear moaning tired hungry think professional main thing would say bad baggage claim buggy last item put round belt lot tired baby parent waiting buggy

On a recent flight EK435 (A380) from Brisbane to Dubai on the 18th of April 2015 the flight had a technical problem shortly after passengers were boarded at 20.30 hrs. Resolution took over 3.5 hours during which all passengers were kept on the airplane with no food or drinks. Water and some fruit juice was distributed reluctantly by the crew after being repeatedly asked it appeared they did not want to go through the bother of having to open and close the trolleys before the flight took off! The Captain made a few sporadic announcements in the 1st hour of waiting and then disappeared leaving announcements to the Purser. All in all the 14 hour flight took all of 17+ hours.

"Was on the Emirates flight Dubai to Delhi in February. Have done this route several times.

We recently flew Emirates to Dubai and then connected to Kuwait. The food and service was second to none. When we flew back from Kuwait our flight was delayed. We originally had 1hr and 30 mins between flights. By the time we landed in Dubai and reached the terminal it was 7.20 am local time. Our flight to Birmingham was due to close at 7.30 am! We ran like crazy to our gate A17. By the time we got there it was 7.35 am! We were then told our gate had been changed to A4. There was no way we were going to make it.

Flying to Dubai from Manchester on 15th March 2015 Boeing 777 flight EK022 seat 21e and 21d. We found the service very poor. The female flight attendant never smiled or offered any greeting. We were not offered any drinks but had to ring the call button twice to get a response. On the second occasion for some water again rang twice and from the first call to receiving the drink was just over 11 minutes. This was before and after lunch not at a busy time. At lunch we had to ask for coffee which the male attendant leaned over to pore I had to ask for milk and sugar. The coffee was lukewarm and the attendant was equally out of sorts with himself. We have never had this treatment on previous Emirate flights. I wondered if we were on a no frills flight or was it because we can only afford to fly economy.

Seattle-Dubai-Delhi and return. My first time with Emirates. Flew economy. 777-300 on all the legs. Positives: decent meals plenty of choices in IFE baggage offloading was quick. Negatives: for some reason during SEA-DXB leg the formation of two lavatories each per section didn't seem to work very well. There always seemed to be a line up. All four times they seem to be always taking off a bit late from all the four points of departure. We were bussed to the terminal at DUB on arrival from DEL which took extra 30 minutes of our lay over. Cabin crew could use a bit more politeness. Too many announcements and most of them were barely audible and sounded like mumblings.

"Just returned from a 3 week break to Oz Manchester to Brisbane (via Dubai) Sydney to Manchester (via Dubai). Have to say I was thoroughly impressed. Yes the service wasn't fantastic from all the cabin crew. Yes the meals weren't fine dining yes improvements can be made but if my 4 legs of this trip is anything to go from I would definitely recommend Emirates A380 services to others. We sat all 4 legs in 59 ABC in order to have the most stable journey so didn't test the levels down the length of this massive aircraft however what we received was extremely good and am looking at booking again for this 22 hour journey with Emirates on the A380. If I were to be critical then improving the food offering would be good and using ""secret shoppers"" to test flight attendants would help I interacted with around 20 flight attendants during these 4 legs and 18 were great it's funny how 2 from 20 will stick out more in my mind. Emirates need to be careful with traffic flow as we had an hour circling prior to landing in Dubai due to congestion and then 3 hours later had an hour sat on stand waiting for a slot due to congestion. In essence I'd definitely recommend the Emirates A380 service safety and comfort are first rate and with a few improvements I'd say even economy is first class!",7,2015-04-08,United Kingdom,False,returned week break oz manchester brisbane via dubai sydney manchester via dubai say thoroughly impressed yes service fantastic cabin crew yes meal fine dining yes improvement made leg trip anything go would definitely recommend emirate service others sat leg abc order stable journey test level length massive aircraft however received extremely good looking booking hour journey emirate critical improving food offering would good using secret shopper test flight attendant would help interacted around flight attendant leg great funny stick mind emirate need careful traffic flow hour circling prior landing dubai due congestion hour later hour sat stand waiting slot due congestion essence definitely recommend emirate service safety comfort first rate improvement say even economy first class
We have flown with Emirates more than 20 times. In the last 4 months we flew Business Class 8 times and First Class once. We have experienced 2 great flights with them but 6 awful flights. Emirates call centre were disorganised and provided conflicting information when we called to try to make changes. The crew in general are by far the worst we have experienced on any airline (including budget airlines). On 4 of the recent flights my wife was pregnant. Emirates made very little attempt to make the flight any better for her. We have flown with Emirates various times over the last 7 years and have found the experience increasingly worse. The food in Business Class has been paired back so much that it is almost inedible. They have chosen to use extremely cheap bread and pastry products as filler. The food at Singapore Business Lounge was inedible I say this as a statement of fact not a complaint. I returned to the main terminal and purchased food and drink from there and brought it back into the lounge. The chauffeur service is also highly variable. At Singapore we were collected by an 8 year old souped up mini van (replete with flashing lights inside and worn out interior) instead of the limousine they promise. We fly a combination of Business and First Class when we use Emirates our reason for this is to try to avoid undue stress when travelling to or from a holiday destination. Unfortunately we have found that for 75% of the time we come home feeling frustrated.

I flew Emirates from Vienna to Harare in March. The difference in quality of aircraft from VIE-DXB to DXB-HRE was staggering. The Africa-bound plane was old the seats were narrow and uncomfortable (comparatively) the in- flight entertainment system was archaic (without even the detailed route tracker that is the standard of other Emirates planes). Before opting for the Business class flight I had flown Emirates coach a number of times and on the newer planes it is far superior to business on the Harare route if value for money is something you care about. Incredibly disappointed. The massive gulf in quality between the Europe-originating route and the Africa-bound one was massive. Unforgivably so given the fact that we were still expected to pay a premium.

"My wife and I flew return business class from Toronto to Bangkok via Dubai. The Toronto to Dubai leg on a newer A380 provided excellent cabin service and food with the exception of the hot breakfast which was well below par. Upon arrival in Dubai we found The business class lounges to be very comfortable providing a good selection of food beverages and reading materials. The Dubai A380 leg went smoothly except for that hot breakfast again which once again proved inedible. The return flight A380 from Bangkok to Dubai was on an older series A380 and was a lot less comfortable due to a built in footrest which prevented me from stretching out my legs. I found this to be very debilitating as I have a bad knee and I was very uncomfortable unless I put the seat into the flat bed position. The Dubai - Toronto return leg was once again on a newer A380 and provided more comfort than the older A380. I still had not learned from my earlier hot breakfast experiences and fell for it a third time. This was by far the worst of all the three breakfasts and I took it upon myself to complain about the poached eggs that had the consistency of hockey pucks. The cabin crew were very apologetic and acknowledged that it was an ongoing issue. Overall the Emirates business class experience was expensive mainly pleasant but could be significantly improved. The chauffeur service was excellent however everything else isn't where it needs to be yet in order for me to stop shopping around for alternatives. My comments and suggestions are listed below. Business class seats are narrow and uncomfortable especially seats F & G which are only separated by an armrest. I was travelling with my wife so we didn't need to use the privacy screen which rises vertically from the armrest. Unfortunately even when it is not in use it still protrudes vertically from the armrest by approximately 9"" preventing use of the armrest for it's intended purpose or even holding hands with your significant other if so inclined. In business class the lounge 4 washrooms galley and stairs to the lower level are all at the rear of the aircraft. This can make for a very busy area particularly with cabin crews comings and goings. It also makes for a very long walk to the washroom if you are seated near the front of the business class section. Kudos to the cabin crew as they delivered all food on trays without resorting to the use of trolleys which would obviously restrict passenger movement and clog up the aisles. Having said that requests for individual items can be met by comments such as ""I'll be back in a minute"". When I mentioned to a member of the flight crew that the flight tracker program wasn't working during the Toronto return leg it was just met by a shrug of shoulders and no explanation? My biggest beef regarding my first Emirates experience is that we never once saw the plane's purser (cabin manager) on any flight as they never appeared from behind the curtain that separates first and business classes.",2,2015-04-06,Canada,False,wife flew return business class toronto bangkok via dubai toronto dubai leg newer provided excellent cabin service food exception hot breakfast well par upon arrival dubai found business class lounge comfortable providing good selection food beverage reading material dubai leg went smoothly except hot breakfast proved inedible return flight bangkok dubai older series lot le comfortable due built footrest prevented stretching leg found debilitating bad knee uncomfortable unless put seat flat bed position dubai toronto return leg newer provided comfort older still learned earlier hot breakfast experience fell third time far worst three breakfast took upon complain poached egg consistency hockey puck cabin crew apologetic acknowledged ongoing issue overall emirate business class experience expensive mainly pleasant could significantly improved chauffeur service excellent however everything else need yet order stop shopping around alternative comment suggestion listed business class seat narrow uncomfortable especially seat f g separated armrest travelling wife need use privacy screen rise vertically armrest unfortunately even use still protrudes vertically armrest approximately preventing use armrest intended purpose even holding hand significant inclined business class lounge washroom galley stair lower level rear aircraft make busy area particularly cabin crew coming going also make long walk washroom seated near front business class section kudos cabin crew delivered food tray without resorting use trolley would obviously restrict passenger movement clog aisle said request individual item met comment back minute mentioned member flight crew flight tracker program working toronto return leg met shrug shoulder explanation biggest beef regarding first emirate experience never saw plane purser cabin manager flight never appeared behind curtain separate first business class
"I am a frequent traveler with Emirates and am sad to say it is all going downhill. MNL-DBX-AMM and CAI-DBX-MNL on the way back. The B777-300 ER is a nice plane with departure at 12.20 am. With all the time spent in the airport and the lousy lounges at Manila airport (not airline's fault) one gets to the flight starving. Just to find out they have ""Light Bites Service"". All options below business class standards. Tiny portion leaves you starving for the rest of the flight until breakfast comes. No service in between. This service takes more than two hours to be completed when people want to go to sleep as soon as possible. Then the connection to Amman was far worse. A330 plane is really bad when the passenger in front of you fully reclines you end up with his head on your lap. When things couldn't get worse they did on the way back. Ground staff at Cairo are as bad as the airport itself. No priority boarding long faces a true mess. Fortunately I was served dinner as it was dinner time. B777-200 also a very bad aircraft. My ICE screen got stuck when the guy in front of me reclined fully. Crew did nothing. Then another red-eye to Manila more ""Light Bites"" service crew took three hours in offering the duvet for the hard seats (by then they already woke me up).

DUB-DBX-PEK and return. Four Emirates Flights in the last 6 days. First sector from Dublin to Dubai was astonishingly poor for an airline as reputable as Emirates. Chaotic boarding late departure - 1hr 10 minute delay. Staff onboard were generally surly abrupt extremely rude and unhelpful. One particular stewardess on this flight demonstrably lacked the people and interpersonal skills required to carry out her responsibilities. The aircraft's ICE system was particularly ineffective and difficult to navigate. However the further three flights resonated as if it were a completely different airline. Staff were utterly professional courteous caring and engaging throughout. The PEK-DBX flight epitomised the standard for exemplary customer service in every way albeit helped by the fantastic A380-800 aircraft used on this sector.

DUB-DXB-PEK and return. First time to fly Emirates. Three flights on the Boeing 777-300 one on the Airbus A380-800. 3/4 sectors typified the renowned Emirates service but DUB-DXB left a lot to be desired with surly uninterested and even some ignorant cabin crew. Some even refused to bring water to passengers. Disgraceful conduct. The IFE system was also difficult to navigate on this sector leading to a less than satisfactory flight.

We flew from Birmingham to Melbourne with stops in Dubai and KL - very satisfactory. Excellent lounges and good departure times so the trip was as painless as possible. Service varied from ok to excellent. Seat 9A and 9B were well positioned comfortable and with good appointments and spaces for storage. Emirates is clearly a top class airline with all the trimmings that a long time traveller expects (for the $$$!). Their entertainment system is a bit hard to navigate.

DMM-DXB-BKK on March 26 - In Economy Emirates has a solid offering few airlines can match. Crews are friendly courteous. I wonder why these crews are not deployed on the long haul route such as LAX even on Business Class of the same route need crews like this set to work on. For example there was a crying infant who tirelessly screamed pretty much the entire flight much to the annoyance of many passengers. One of the crew offered the mother to look after the screaming child although not taken by the offered customer her kindness and customer orientation is surely noticed by other passengers. Food on this route is enjoyable Asian style chicken. Got upgraded to Business on the first leg which is very nice of Emirates to recognize my status with them.

"ADL-DXB-VCE return March 2015. B777-300ERs all legs. First time on EK and must say I was impressed certainly compared to QF long haul. Able to use the Qantas lounge in ADL due to QF status nothing out of the ordinary but you need to allow time to pass through immigration etc at the gate. Boarding started well ahead of time (on all legs) and was strictly by seating zone which worked well and lead to on time departures all 4 legs. I prefer an aisle seat and on 3 of the 4 legs the middle seat was unoccupied. Chose the small Y class section just behind business which was good. I found the seat and leg room good but then I am quite short. Note that aisle seats don't always have power plugs but the USBs worked well. ICE was impressive but the relentless ads got a bit annoying after a while even though you can fast forward them. Service was universally good and friendly albeit with the inevitable slightly ""plastic"" airline feel to it. Hot towels menus small amenity kit. Food was more than adequate on all legs and always got my preference. Trays cleared away promptly regular drinks runs and staff seemed to respond to individual calls. Liked the mood lighting overnight and slept well. Transit in DXB worked well no long lines at security even a peak hours. One bus transfer but very efficient. Used the lounge in DXB - yes its big but just move away from the central hub and there are lots of quiet spots to chill out. All in all I was happy with my flights and would certainly use EK again on these experiences.",2,2015-03-28,Australia,False,adl dxb vce return march b er leg first time ek must say impressed certainly compared qf long haul able use qantas lounge adl due qf status nothing ordinary need allow time pas immigration etc gate boarding started well ahead time leg strictly seating zone worked well lead time departure leg prefer aisle seat leg middle seat unoccupied chose small class section behind business good found seat leg room good quite short note aisle seat always power plug usbs worked well ice impressive relentless ad got bit annoying even though fast forward service universally good friendly albeit inevitable slightly plastic airline feel hot towel menu small amenity kit food adequate leg always got preference tray cleared away promptly regular drink run staff seemed respond individual call liked mood lighting overnight slept well transit dxb worked well long line security even peak hour one bus transfer efficient used lounge dxb yes big move away central hub lot quiet spot chill happy flight would certainly use ek experience
I flew business class from New York to Dubai. I was so looking forward to it since I heard that it was in a class by itself. What a disappointment. The crew were well scrubbed in their uniforms and led me to my seat. It consisted of a small cube like area with a nice sized video screen. I soon found out that the space was very constricting. My wife was next to me and a partition between us was lowered but not all the way. There was a 4 inch portion that still protruded that did not allow for comfortable placement of my arm. The lie flat seats were not truly lie flat. By the way this was an A380 and the seats were more 175 degrees. The head area seemed a little bit elevated. There was a cushion-mattress that was given to place over the reclined seat that did make it more comfortable but the confined space of the pod like area was uncomfortable. I could not really move my arms very well around my head. I had flown Air New Zealand a few months ago and their business class on a 777 was far superior. When I arrived on New York on the return the flight was an hour late. Even though my baggage was checked thru to Jetblue when I went through customs and tried to recheck the baggage I was told it was too late for it to be transferred to the Jetblue flight. It was 55 minutes to the flight and they needed an hour at least. The Emirates rep said she could not help me. I thought that she could have provided a porter to take the luggage over to Jetblue with me but I had to do that on my own. My next trip to Dubai I am going to try Etihad business and I hope that the experience is better.,7,2015-03-28,United States,False,flew business class new york dubai looking forward since heard class disappointment crew well scrubbed uniform led seat consisted small cube like area nice sized video screen soon found space constricting wife next partition u lowered way inch portion still protruded allow comfortable placement arm lie flat seat truly lie flat way seat degree head area seemed little bit elevated cushion mattress given place reclined seat make comfortable confined space pod like area uncomfortable could really move arm well around head flown air new zealand month ago business class far superior arrived new york return flight hour late even though baggage checked thru jetblue went custom tried recheck baggage told late transferred jetblue flight minute flight needed hour least emirate rep said could help thought could provided porter take luggage jetblue next trip dubai going try etihad business hope experience better

BRU-HKG via DXB return 1st class. Fab driver pick service in all legs from residence to airport to hotel and back and to residence. A big plus! Check in fast as it should be. Fast track and lounge a pity. EK uses SN lounge and it is outdated and crowed always. Whatever time of day. Used not only by Star alliance members but also other partners too which makes it too warm overcrowded and nowhere to seat. Boarding ok and then the usual fab experience of EK first class although on B777 suites are smaller and not the luxury of showers. No amenity kit either. Connecting in Dubai is a mess. Non one around and the first class in concourse C is small and not that good. Again boarding to HKG very average and not prioritized as it should be. A380 excellent experience not my first one with them but meals are very average. Excellent ICE. Return on HKG - Dubai leg not so good staff were rude and unpleasant. Again connecting in course C is a mess. Last leg ok. Bag not first out and unfortunately zip was broken and lock missing. To have the bag repaired took me forever and wasted a whole day waiting for a pick up service who after an 8 hour wait never turned up. Very disappointed. Customer service is not good either. However staff in EK office in BRU helpful and hopefully all will be sorted out soon. Not yet done though.

Airbus 380 LHR-DXB and return. Normally fly Qatar but Emirates were more convenient times so I gave them a go. Overall good but not as good as Qatar. Not impressed with the 380 Business cabin they've tried to squeeze in too many seats. OK I'm big but I've never had to ask for a seat extender before in business. Couldn't get the tray fully extended difficult to sleep as too cramped. Cabin staff excellent but due to size of cabin (over 20 rows) we got our wine after we had finished our food. Food fine.

I regularly fly Emirates from LGW-DXB-MNL and return. I have never had an issue until my last flight from Manila to the UK. Arriving at Manila for check in found that the flight was overbooked and Emirates were asking for volunteers to give up their seat. As a Silver member I was advised that I would be upgraded to business class for the MNL-DXB leg of the journey and all seemed well. The service on this leg was great meals were excellent and the business class cabin was roomy and comfortable. The only downside with this flight the entertainment system which wasn't working in Business class for most of the flight. The second leg from DXB to LGW was in economy class and this version of the 777 was very cramped much more cramped than previous Emirates 777 flights. Service was good though when trolley service was completed they struck the arm rest with the trolley breaking the headset plug leaving the prongs embedded in the socket. This resulted in the rest of the flight with no sound for entertainment system.

Nicely appointed well decorated cabin crew helpful attentive and smiley. Food although not exceptional was more than acceptable and service was first class. No complaints whatsoever about the flight. The problems began at Dubai. Very busy so held before landing. Dumped at least a 20 min bus trip from terminal. No information of where connecting (Qantas) flight was departing from. No one in terminal to ask. Inserted boarding pass into state of art machine that was supposed to tell us where to go - it didn't. 15/20 min fast walk to train to change terminals. Rush to gate and just made it as gate was closing. 4 people at least didn't make it and had bags off-loaded. This was simply not good enough.

EK010 LGW-DXB was on an A380. The plane seemed very new with nice entertainment system and it was updated with the latest IFE system with a 10 inch HD screen. Seats were comfortable with lots of space to straighten your legs cabin crew were nice and friendly and food was delicious. The next flight from DXB-BOM was on an outdated B777-300 seats were quite old including the IFE system but the content was almost the same cabin crew were not friendly they seemed to be in rush all the time food was ok.

Dubai to Sydney Economy Class. After reading other postings here for Emirates just had to add my comments. I have travelled Emirates for many years but I feel customer service from the crew is getting worse. Friendly FAs are rare these days. The others just do the minimum of what needs doing without a smile. Almost knock you over if you are in their way. A couple of people took our seats and wouldn't move but the FAs couldn't care less. The once fabulous selection on ICE is deteriorating too. Plenty to see but a poor selection in English unless you like violent movies. Whatever happened to the snack pack with a drink at the beginning of a flight? Not served on my flight. Some passengers rang for the FA but they didn't come. Yes some might ring for minor things but on the other hand it could be an emergency. Annoying things on a long 14 hour trip these small things make a difference to the passengers. Lift your game Emirates or more people will be looking elsewhere. I firmly believe any airline is only as good as its crew. I am due another flight next week to Europe. Hope this is a better experience.,6,2015-03-17,Australia,False,dubai sydney economy class reading posting emirate add comment travelled emirate many year feel customer service crew getting worse friendly fa rare day others minimum need without smile almost knock way couple people took seat move fa care le fabulous selection ice deteriorating plenty see poor selection english unless like violent movie whatever happened snack pack drink beginning flight served flight passenger rang fa come yes might ring minor thing hand could emergency annoying thing long hour trip small thing make difference passenger lift game emirate people looking elsewhere firmly believe airline good crew due another flight next week europe hope better experience

My advice would be to avoid Emirates until Dubai Airport improvements have finished: too many planes have to park out on the apron meaning 30 minutes extra until into the terminal delayed baggage and rushed connections. Customer Service standards also seem to be slipping. On arrival at the airport I was informed my flight was delayed 3 hours but wasn't told that an earlier flight was also delayed and I could have caught that one and still made an onward connection. The previous couple of flights also had delayed arrivals (up to 2 hours) and therefore incredibly rushed connections (with onward flight delayed to wait for connecting passengers). Hope they return to previous high standards soon.,9,2015-03-04,Malaysia,False,advice would avoid emirate dubai airport improvement finished many plane park apron meaning minute extra terminal delayed baggage rushed connection customer service standard also seem slipping arrival airport informed flight delayed hour told earlier flight also delayed could caught one still made onward connection previous couple flight also delayed arrival hour therefore incredibly rushed connection onward flight delayed wait connecting passenger hope return previous high standard soon

Flew as a package Heathrow to Dubai Dubai to Colombo Colombo to Male Male to Dubai Dubai to Heathrow. On all of our paperwork we had numbered seats together. We actually sat in these seats on the first flight and never sat together again. After 3 days in Dubai we arrived at the airport after midnight to find that there were no seats on the plane so ours had been sold to someone else. We waited to see if there would be seats as we had a connection waiting for us in Colombo. Desk was hopelessly undermanned and after a long wait no seats available anywhere on the plane. After 20 minutes or so it was clear there wasn't a hotel to go to either so spent an uncomfortable night in a cold Dubai airport with a voucher for probably the cheapest meal in the cafe. Got on the next plane in the morning which was delayed by an hour. We did get a voucher to travel from Dubai to Colombo! How this airline has built a reputation for being one of top carriers is beyond us. The only thing that was better than the cheapest airlines was the entertainment system but no way can this make up for the rest of our experience. We did write to express how we thought that our experience should be giving real cause for concern to customer relations.

Flew SIN-BNE in J class on the 77W. This is my second and last flight with EK in business class and I had hoping for a better experience with them the second time around. This did not happen. The crew looked bored and as though they did not want to be there. They missed our welcome drink and I had to ask for ours as they collected everyone else's empty glasses. Then during the service the crew kept forgetting which rows they had served. A drink and nuts after take off were offered and then it was almost two hours before we were offered our first course. The fun started trying to get a glass of wine. They do not serve wine automatically with the meal like other airlines and instead walk around with a type of wine rack with a few glasses on it. Good luck getting their attention to get a glass. They walked past us three times while we sat looking at them expecting a glass of wine with our entree. I was served red but my partner was ignored. I rang my call bell and they arrived to see what could be wrong with me. A few minutes later the same FA walked past offering bread and no wine. At this point I lost my temper and could not believe what was happening. My partner had finished the entree and not had a drink for over two hours ago by now. Eventually the white wine came and the rest of the service was ordinary. They had no idea which wines they were serving or where they came from. It was just red or white and you pointed at which one you wanted. The food was very average quite boring. To me this airline just lacks soul. The IFE was good and the ground staff at SIN airport and the lounge were delightful.

"My wife and myself flew from Glasgow to Sydney return January and February 2015 on economy. The worst flying experience. Five Emirates flights and all of them delayed! On two of the flights home they failed to serve two meals they even had the gall to state ""due to inclement weather economy meals will not be served"" OK if you were business or first but economy forget it! On the last flight back from Bangkok to Dubai the flight was late arriving we were met by Emirates staff who said our flight was being held for seven of us. We were rushed through Dubai airport (very large airport and some of us had ailments) no transport arranged. When we reached the departure gate the staff there told us ""its too late for you to get on we did tell arrivals this!"" We were then directed from desk to desk to make arrangements for another flight five desks in all we were sent too in all corners of Dubai airport. We managed to book flights later in the day and they offered us their hotel to shower etc. This meant another group around Dubai airport to get back through customs and to find the bus. We asked if we could just use the airport lounge due to the people suffering from all the walking and we were told ""you cannot use the lounge that is for business and first class only"". By the time we reached the hotel we just had time to shower eat a late breakfast and back to the airport to go through customs and immigration again. Emirates could not have made us feel any worse with there attitude and behaviour. Our advise to you if you are travelling economy is to go for another airline we have traveled on China Eastern and found the service much better than Emirates provide.",9,2015-02-24,United Kingdom,False,wife flew glasgow sydney return january february economy worst flying experience five emirate flight delayed two flight home failed serve two meal even gall state due inclement weather economy meal served ok business first economy forget last flight back bangkok dubai flight late arriving met emirate staff said flight held seven u rushed dubai airport large airport u ailment transport arranged reached departure gate staff told u late get tell arrival directed desk desk make arrangement another flight five desk sent corner dubai airport managed book flight later day offered u hotel shower etc meant another group around dubai airport get back custom find bus asked could use airport lounge due people suffering walking told cannot use lounge business first class time reached hotel time shower eat late breakfast back airport go custom immigration emirate could made u feel worse attitude behaviour advise travelling economy go another airline traveled china eastern found service much better emirate provide
Flight EK148 AMS-DXB on 7/2/2015 in business class. Boarding in AMS was a joke. The economy class pax blocked the way to the gate exit to the aircraft. The ground staff did nothing here when boarding for the first and business class passengers began. Chaos was the word that came to my mind. About 20 minutes delay on departure. Food was of poor quality. The inflight service no better than any other 4-star airline. The seats are acceptable and provide ample space. We were transported by bus to the terminal upon arrival in Dubai. This took about 20 minutes. Another 20 minutes walk to the to the train for transport to the next terminal and another 15 minutes to get to the lounge. What happened to their so-called famous A380 terminal where all A380 aircraft can be handeld. Lounge was OK. Flight EK384 DXB-BKK on 8/2/2015 in business class. No exciting flight. What you can expected for the price you paid for business class. Food was mediocre. FA were friendly and gave good service. Flight EK385 BKK-DXB on 19/2/2015.

Flying Perth to Manchester for a funeral both out and return flights delayed therefore missed connecting flights on each trip (facing an extra 10 hours on the return leg). On arrival at Dubai no one met the passengers to offer directions to desks etc and on asking to use the lounge to send an email was met with a 'no' - not every one has a fancy phone with internet service! Hotel voucher led to a hotel room for a 'sleep' of approx 3hrs not worth the effort.

My husband and have just returned from our holiday to Sri-Lanka and Dubai. We used Emirates on all four flights. We were very happy with Emirates except for our return flight home from Dubai. The service was not what we had previously experienced with the airline. We were some while into our flight when our first meal arrived clearly there was some delay with this meal as our next meal arrived within approximately an hour. It all seemed a little chaotic. We appreciate that the cabin crew worked hard and were very busy throughout the flight however during the other three flights in a two week period the service was excellent.

Flew Manchester-Dubai-Singapore and returned three weeks later. Going out OK but remember much longer journey than with other airlines you also have to change planes. Service in past has made this acceptable not any more will I be doing it. Earphones were not working so entertainment not good going out on one half of outward journey. Return journey was a nightmare. Plane full and a seat in front that came so far back I had trouble opening my tray. The guy in front watched movies all the way but was not concerned that I had no room. Monitor did not work for three hours so they reset it three times before it worked. Seatbelt was falling apart. Toilet had no water in sink after putting soap on hands. Water dispenser also was not working. Second meal before landing not served. I was already unhappy from first leg. Second flight was from the other side of the airport a good thirty minutes dash never had such a distance on such a tiring journey. Dubai to Manchester now another eight hours if you are lucky. Problems with a forty ton machine being loaded in cargo hold falls off pallets and jams luggage hold. We sit in our seats for two hours waiting to take off. We eventually do set off. Leave aircraft and immediately complain on website. No answer as yet.

Flew from Birmingham UK to Dubai on 27th January and did not enjoy the experience. Cabin crew were terrible. Half the plane received a hot towel before takeoff and then the crew could not be bothered with the rest of us and abandoned it. Dinner service was dreadful. The rows behind us received their food about an hour before we did but then they had to sit with their food trays for about another 2 hours before being cleared away. It was 3 hours in before we received our first drink. Finally the menu said we would get a hot drink and sweet treat before landing - nothing given. The crew were so slow it was unbelievable. Flew back from Singapore yesterday via Dubai and could not believe this was the same airline. Yes we all got given hot towels and again before landing.

"Business class on EK 418 BKK-SYD. The flight itself on a 777 was good and my wife and I managed to get a decent rest on the angled seats. Had a very enthusiastic crew serving us with a smile. Dinner was well presented. We missed breakfast as we were asleep. Departure and arrival on time. Aircraft equipped with older ICE but not a problem on this medium haul night flight. Main negatives at check-in and upon arrival. I was very surprised that our reserved seats (9 K and J) were no longer assigned to us even though booked more than 6 months in advance. I am platinum with QF (code share on this flight) so got a bit upset as the check-in staff at the first class check- in in BKK tried to put us in to the middle row of three with one aisle and one middle seat. After rejecting this seat change lady suddenly ""found"" seats 10 K and J for us. Could not work out why our initially reserved seats were no longer available (managed to look at the boarding passes of both passengers sitting in 9 K & J and they had no status with EK or QF). Second negative aspect of the trip during luggage collection at SYD. Even though our 2 suitcases were both properly labeled with ""First"" labels and we checked-in at BKK 2.5 hours prior to departure our suitcases appeared as one of the last items on the belt in Sydney. As I said to my wife first economy passengers of our flight were already checking in to their hotels in Sydney while we were still waiting for our baggage. An overall great flight but check-in at BKK and luggage return in SYD needs to be improved. Also not impressed with the EK Lounge in BKK.

"BKK-SYD on a 777-300ER. Emirates will always score points when I travel on their A380s and 77Ws. The IFE is brilliant and the food and beverage service is excellent for an economy class product. This flight was let down a little by the crew. They clearly did not get on well with one another and for some this carried over to their dealings with passengers. The PA announcements also seemed overdone with little thought to the timing of some especially when being delivered in three languages. I found the boarding process interesting. Row numbers were called in increments of 5 logically starting from the back. There appeared to be an insistence that the entire gate area was scoured for every last passenger within the designated rows before the next 5 rows were called. I have never seen a 777 boarded so slowly resulting in a 20 minute delay. It looked like the ""rules"" were getting in the way of reasonableness and that overly technical atmosphere summed up the flight. This flight was QF- ticketed and my outbound journey was with QF. I rated them the same overall but for different reasons. Emirates has the hard product in its grasp but I preferred the QF flight for its reassuring professionalism.",9,2015-02-11,Australia,False,bkk syd er emirate always score point travel w ife brilliant food beverage service excellent economy class product flight let little crew clearly get well one another carried dealing passenger pa announcement also seemed overdone little thought timing especially delivered three language found boarding process interesting row number called increment logically starting back appeared insistence entire gate area scoured every last passenger within designated row next row called never seen boarded slowly resulting minute delay looked like rule getting way reasonableness overly technical atmosphere summed flight flight qf ticketed outbound journey qf rated overall different reason emirate hard product grasp preferred qf flight reassuring professionalism
I flew SIN-DXB-BHX after spending New Year in Singapore. I cannot believe that the standards have gone down so badly. I have been flying EK since 2006. Transit in Dubai - Dubai airport can be a huge one and boast of passenger numbers but the reality is that it is finding hard to cater to the growth. Terminal 3 is supposed to be exclusive for EK but why no aerobridges provided. My flight departed SIN at 01.20 landed at around 05.00 in DXB. EK parked their B777-300ER somewhere at the far end of the airport and we were made to climb down the staircase at that time. We were packed in a bus and sent to the terminal which took some 15 to 20 min. I entered the terminal at around 5.45am and walked down for security check. Finally at around 6.30am I reached my gate B30. After the boarding pass check guess what we are asked to board a bus again for a 15 min ride to the far end of the airport where they have parked their B777-300ER again. There was no proper organised zonal boarding as everyone just boarded the flight through the rear door and had to queue a lot before taking the seats inside the flight. Inflight Service - The inflight service was awful. The standards have down in this area since 2010. Their food portions have gone down I always felt hungry after the meal! Cabin crew don't want to move from their seats at all! If you want something it is always better to go to the galley rather than wait for anyone.,5,2015-02-11,United Kingdom,False,flew sin dxb bhx spending new year singapore cannot believe standard gone badly flying ek since transit dubai dubai airport huge one boast passenger number reality finding hard cater growth terminal supposed exclusive ek aerobridges provided flight departed sin landed around dxb ek parked b er somewhere far end airport made climb staircase time packed bus sent terminal took min entered terminal around walked security check finally around reached gate b boarding pas check guess asked board bus min ride far end airport parked b er proper organised zonal boarding everyone boarded flight rear door queue lot taking seat inside flight inflight service inflight service awful standard area since food portion gone always felt hungry meal cabin crew want move seat want something always better go galley rather wait anyone
LHR-DXB-BKK-DXB-LHR. Four flights in a A380s in a week. Service was slick and professional but there were signs of cost-cutting. Some of the meals were excellent and other mediocre. Boarding the flights was a relatively anarchic process. There were two specific problems that were drawn to my attention by the cabin crew. The first is that many of the business passengers had apparently been upgraded from economy because Emirates had overbooked the flight. This meant that the cabin crew upstairs were working extremely hard and were perhaps not quite as happy as they normally are. The second was the build quality of the A380. For instance two of the four bathroom doors at the rear of business were faulty on a relatively new aircraft (A6-EEN) and according to the cabin crew there were quite a few other similar issues. This is of course not necessarily the fault of Emirates but quite a lot of passengers seem irritated when the light failed to come on it one of the bathrooms and the door failed to shut in another. It never ceases to amaze me that having been building bathrooms in aircraft for many decades manufacturers still haven't managed to work out how to design cup dispensers that allow you to take one cup at a time or tissue dispensers the release a single tissue rather than a handful. That said the cabin crew were assiduous on all of the flights in keeping the bathrooms clean. The flatbed seat was extremely comfortable especially with a mattress although sitting towards the rear of the aircraft meant that there was a constant matter of closing doors from the galley. The OnAir Internet works fine for the LHR-DXB leg and enables you to download your emails (assuming no large attachments) for free because it starts charging at 10MB and even then is not overpriced. However on the return leg it did not appear to work at all. GSM also worked at the cabin crew reminded passengers to keep their phones on silent to avoid disturbing people.,3,2015-02-11,United Kingdom,False,lhr dxb bkk dxb lhr four flight week service slick professional sign cost cutting meal excellent mediocre boarding flight relatively anarchic process two specific problem drawn attention cabin crew first many business passenger apparently upgraded economy emirate overbooked flight meant cabin crew upstairs working extremely hard perhaps quite happy normally second build quality instance two four bathroom door rear business faulty relatively new aircraft een according cabin crew quite similar issue course necessarily fault emirate quite lot passenger seem irritated light failed come one bathroom door failed shut another never cease amaze building bathroom aircraft many decade manufacturer still managed work design cup dispenser allow take one cup time tissue dispenser release single tissue rather handful said cabin crew assiduous flight keeping bathroom clean flatbed seat extremely comfortable especially mattress although sitting towards rear aircraft meant constant matter closing door galley onair internet work fine lhr dxb leg enables download email assuming large attachment free start charging mb even overpriced however return leg appear work gsm also worked cabin crew reminded passenger keep phone silent avoid disturbing people

In December I flew from Zurich to Dubai. I was excited to fly the A380. However my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after experiencing the absolute crankiness of the cabin crew. Although never really rude the flight stewardesses were all very short and only busy with themselves. Their body language and facial expressions were often as if they'd rather be somewhere else and as if were a constant nuisance. The A380 (AMS-DUB) itself is a very nice plane spacious and modern. The onboard entertainment was pretty good and the extra touch were the cameras outside the plane so you could watch the outside surroundings from your screen in front of you. The return trip with a 777 was also disappointing. Emirates could not seat us together on the 6 hrs flight despite that we booked under the same booking reference number.

"Last October I flew from Amsterdam to Jakarta through Dubai. I was excited to fly the A380. However my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after experiencing the absolute crankiness of the cabin crew. Although never really rude the flight stewardesses were pretty much all very short almost 'bitchy' and only busy with themselves. Their body language and facial expressions were often as if they'd rather be somewhere else and as if were a constant nuisance. The A380 (AMS-DUB) itself is a very nice plane spacious and modern. The onboard entertainment was pretty good and the extra touch were the cameras outside the plane so you could watch the outside surroundings from your screen in front of you. Between Dubai and Jakarta they use a Boeing 777. Another disappointment! The plane on the inside was old seats smelled and looked like they definitely could use new fabrics. The entertainment screen was small and old (my 3 year old tablet has a better screen than that onboard the 777 of Emirates) supposedly touch screen it worked horribly even with the remote control device. Different plane and different crew but not a different mentality of the crew. From Jakarta to Dubai we flew again with the 777. Same complaints as on the way to Jakarta and on top of that when we arrived 5am in Dubai we had to get out of the plane far from the terminal building. We had to use stairs to get out and clearly the stairs weren't designed to handle such a large plane since there was quite the difference in height between the stairs and the exit door of the plane. When I asked the crew why we didn't taxi to the terminal the reply was ""there is no available gate"". This is the home base of Emirates and there is no place for its own planes? From the runway we had to take a shuttle bus to the terminal which took about 20 to 30 minutes. From there it was very confusing where to go once inside the terminal building.

RUH-DXB-MRU and back. Aug 15 RUH-DXB left Riyadh on time at 9.25 pm on a 777-300 ER. Service was excellent and the staff were kind! There were a few food choices (it was a short 1.5 hr flight) and I think it was Chicken Biriani or Fish. I had the Biriani and it was excellent (but spicy!). The IFE was very good and kept me entertained. We arrived to Dubai and they gave us fast track cards but we didn't need that since we were transiting in DXB for about 3 hrs. DXB was very busy and noisy. Arrived to the lounge and it was packed with barely anywhere to sit! Finally found a place near the buffet but it was pretty noisy. Our flight to MRU left at 3.10am (on the 16th and again on time so EK are pretty good at being on schedule) on an A380. It was a pretty nice plane but I had a few problems with the cabin and seat. The mini bar on the left (or right depends on where you're sitting) of the seat is pretty bulky and makes the seat more narrow and quite uncomfortable to sleep as it's quite tight (but it was a flat bed so I'll give it points for that). Another problem was that the cabin for Business was huge! It barely felt like Business from the amount of seats in the cabin! I sat in the smaller cabin on the back so I didn't have the problem that much and it didn't affect the service of the staff but it makes Business less premium. Once again the IFE and food service were excellent. For the lounge in the back of the deck I really enjoyed that! On the return flight I left MRU in the evening so I didn't have to sleep on that flight (and it was pretty much the same thing but the cabin was much busier).

We flew A380 to Dubai then 777 to Bangkok. Both flights on time. Loved the A380 it was so spacious we sat in row 88 at the back. The A380 was really quiet too.

Series of Trips on EK MEL-CMB-MEL and CMB-CAI-CMB. All sectors in Business except DXB-CMB which was in First. Check in Good. Lounges not bad. However the quality of food in DXB has been going down over time. Good Welcome on Boarding. IFE is AVOD and excellent as always. Staff can be hit or miss mostly a miss. The quality of meals on board keeps going down every month. Bread basket is brought around only when you are nearly done with the main. Of all the sectors I flew the food on EK 650 First Class from DXB to CMB was the worst. The curry sauce which accompanied the rice tasted like chillies mixed with water. Depending on how much you pay for ticket it is still value for money. But EK is on a steep downward spiral. And if you have any comments or complains post flight and write to their customer service desk do not be surprise if you get a watered down response which is a border line insult.,10,2015-01-23,Australia,False,series trip ek mel cmb mel cmb cai cmb sector business except dxb cmb first check good lounge bad however quality food dxb going time good welcome boarding ife avod excellent always staff hit miss mostly miss quality meal board keep going every month bread basket brought around nearly done main sector flew food ek first class dxb cmb worst curry sauce accompanied rice tasted like chilli mixed water depending much pay ticket still value money ek steep downward spiral comment complains post flight write customer service desk surprise get watered response border line insult

In Seattle you had to ring a bell and a man would appear from behind a curtain to give you a drink (obviously economizing) no food. Crews on outward leg helpful and professional.

LHR-DXB-BKK Economy. Check-in pretty efficient in T3. The flight was full (as usual) with Emirates and left on time. The A380 is much quieter than the 777 but there's not much difference in the seats/space. Cabin service on Emirates is variable depending on the crew and this one was OK - nothing special. Economy food has improved recently and quite tasty. Good choice of drinks and frequent water/juice runs. On time into DXB and A380's park at the gate instead of remote stands which makes connections easier. I got upgraded to Business on the DXB-BKK leg again an A380 which was about 30mins late. The best part of Business on Emirates is a priority pass for immigration in BKK. The cabin service in Business was nothing special and I prefer to eat in the lounge rather than on the flight.

The flight from Hamburg to Dubai was two hours delayed and service on board started 25 hours after take-off. I pushed the service button in order to receive some water for taking medicine the only thing that happened was that after ten minutes a Stewardess came by switched of the service sign and went away. I pushed the button a second time and the same happened again. Furthermore there was only once service on an 8 hours flight. Food unfortunately below standard.

FRA-DXB-BKK-DXB-FRA. Must take EK again for the flight to Bangkok due to the best price base on 6 months advance booking. FRA-DXB on A380 nice aircraft-flight full but still roomy DXB-BKK on B777 did not get the selected seats (even those seats are selected 6 months in advance by the time of booking on EK Tool) EK has changed our seats and we did not sit together/flight full - no more to say about the 3-4-3 seating. Worst service of all sectors slow service we requested water but were told to wait for the next service. BKK-DXB-FRA on A380/B777 flight full our choice of foods ran out on every sector. I've flown Emirates over a period of six years and I can definitively say that every time I fly the service is getting worse. Its route networks and frequencies are very good and its fares (if booking at least 3 months in advance) can be competitive. However EK progressively gets worse. EK is still on cutting back massively on quality example no amenity kits for Y class foods (quality and quantity) is getting worse cutting the Skywards-mileage counts too small number of cabin crews in Y cabin and they are disinterested in passenger service avoid service to passengers disregards the calling sign. Very chaotic and very slow on board-services choice of foods ran out very early no organization. All those bad on board services EK fare is no more valuable for money.

DXB - IAD [Washington DC] in January 2015 economy class. Given the only choice on this direct route is either Emirates or United it's not really much in the way of competition - give me Emirates every time. Emirates has an excellent on-demand in-flight entertainment system decent food efficient multi-lingual staff amenity packs in economy on long-haul flights and all drinks except champagne are complementary in economy. No one really wants to be stuck on a plane for 15 hours but it's on these really long routes that the little extras on Emirates - especially the in-flight entertainment system and power outlets for every seat - come into their own.,8,2015-01-23,United Arab Emirates,False,dxb iad washington dc january economy class given choice direct route either emirate united really much way competition give emirate every time emirate excellent demand flight entertainment system decent food efficient multi lingual staff amenity pack economy long haul flight drink except champagne complementary economy one really want stuck plane hour really long route little extra emirate especially flight entertainment system power outlet every seat come

We flew in August 2014 from Rio de Janeiro - Dubai and Dubai to Shanghai. We travelled with 2 children (3 months and 26 months). On our first flight the toddlers TV was broken so he used my husbands and mine couldn't be used as we had the bassinet for our baby. Staff were friendly though. One our second flight my seat didn't recline I was promised at the start of the flight that they could manually do it after the meal was served so I thought that was reasonable after the meal however they told me it couldn't be done I would just have to accept it. So for an 8 hour flight I sat upright with a baby on my lap as he wasn't allowed to use the bassinet most of the time because of turbulence. However our toddler slept in his aviation approved car seat that their telephone service agents said we couldn't use. I think their customer service needs improving they tried to tell me I needed to buy 2 seats to use one car seat for a toddler whose seat I had already purchased. However at the airport everything was ok due to a nice customer agent who was able to place all our family together when again customer service had placed us all separately. The airline didn't live up to the expectation that we had and we fly long haul several times per year.,6,2015-01-21,China,False,flew august rio de janeiro dubai dubai shanghai travelled child month month first flight toddler tv broken used husband mine used bassinet baby staff friendly though one second flight seat recline promised start flight could manually meal served thought reasonable meal however told done would accept hour flight sat upright baby lap allowed use bassinet time turbulence however toddler slept aviation approved car seat telephone service agent said use think customer service need improving tried tell needed buy seat use one car seat toddler whose seat already purchased however airport everything ok due nice customer agent able place family together customer service placed u separately airline live expectation fly long haul several time per year
We were a party of eight travelling to Male via Dubai on the 20 December 2014 for two magical weeks in the Maldives. Going out had a 3hr stopover in Dubai which was changed to 3hr 40 minutes Our return flight times were good leaving Dubai at 2.35pm. 5 week before we were due to travel we were advised Emirates had changed their flight schedule meaning our flight from Male did not leave enough time to transfer the luggage from one flight to another. The only option we were given was a 12.5 hr delay or return a day early from our holiday We ended up using Dubai connect which was not good experience. We paid quite a bit more to go with Emirates than another leading airline.

LHR-DXB-PER-DXB-LHR. The trip out to Perth was almost a tale of two different airlines. LHR-DXB on the A380. The Heathrow lounge is dull and there was little sign of staff. It was not made clear that boarding would be straight from the lounge. Once on board a welcome drink was proposed but never arrived. No amenities kit was offered. The plastic bags they put the headphones etc in look cheap and nasty. The much-vaunted wireless IFE controller would not unlock from its dock so not much use. 3 different cabin staff said they would deal with it but nothing was achieved. Meal service was unduly slow. No drinks served (as promised) before the end of the flight. The promised Dubai gate information on IFE channel 94 didn't materialise. Yes it was business class but it was all very impersonal and irritating. The toilets are just by the bar area so if you are queuing you are mixed up with the bar clients - not a comfortable arrangement. DXB-PER on a B777 was totally different: perfect service and everything worked. PER-DXB the seatbelt adjuster didn't work and couldn't be fixed and they eventually cobbled something together with an extender - a bit embarrassing to be presented with that in front of other passengers. Again the IFE controller didn't work. We got to the Dubai area on schedule then had to hold for 40 minutes due to congestion. When we landed we were parked at a (very) remote stand which meant a long bus ride to the terminal. Terminal 3 is enormous and impersonal and there was no time left to do any duty free shopping. DXB-LHR was ok. The IFE controller didn't work - again! So all in all I'm not that satisfied with Emirates. There seems to be a lack of attention to detail. I've flown LHR-PER once a year for the past 10 years and have used Qantas Singapore Malaysian and Qatar all in business class. I'd rank Emirates at the bottom of this list.

Whilst I noticed the narrower seating (Being 777) on my way to London (Emirates) I was lucky then to have a corner seat right in the area which is usually reserved for parents with small children. But yesterday I arrived back in Perth from Dubai on an 11-hour flight on the same Boeing 777-300ER and my coccyx and lower back are still aching from the narrow seating. I can only say I am going to carefully consider my next flight maybe even save up for 2nd class. Cattle class is just that I am not obese but have wide hips and shoulders and I am above average height. The seats on the Boeing 777-300ER were a good 2.5 inches narrower than on the remainder of my particular flight ( Dubai London) legroom is less and the back can only be minimally adjusted. Sleep is impossible. Service was very average crew seemed to be permanently engaged in jockeying their unwieldy carts in that narrower passage-ways food options ran out quickly. The entertainment options do not make up for the unpleasantness of the entire experience. Of course comfort is supplied to the higher-paying customers. I really do resent this!

This was my first time with Emirates and did not find it worth all the hype and pricey tickets. Traveled on an A380 on 3 legs of our trip and seat size + legroom was not very comfortable for a 14 hour flight. There is hardly any space to stretch or walk around a bit on the flight. Staff was courteous and polite however service wasn't quick enough but I think that's just due to the number of passengers on the flight. At one point it took them more than an hour to collect our plates after we finished our meal. Food was okay nothing great or exceptional.

DFW-DXB-BOM: Booked Emirates as it was the cheapest and got a very good deal. The aircraft from Dallas was A380 which cannot be doubted on its comfort. I requested an exit row seat and got it.

Service from Dubai to Mumbai was okayish nothing great to talk about. Old Boeing 777-300 which was stinking. I think Emirates doesn't focus properly on one of its major markets India with respect to quality and service. Overall I would give 3.5 stars to Emirates. 4 for DFW-DXB leg and 3 for DXB-BOM leg.

DUB-DXB-DEL. The flight from Dublin was delayed which meant I was a bit worried about my connecting flight from Dubai as I only had about 2 hours transit but transit was pretty smooth. I had a positive experience with the security staff at Dubai airport - the guy who checked me was polite and smiled. Compared to Doha airport Dubai seemed a lot better organized. This was my first time transiting through Dubai and I was impressed. The food on both flights was decent without being outstanding. For vegetarians Air India and Jet Airways definitely offer a superior product. The staff on the Delhi flight neglected to distribute immigration forms which meant that the foreigners on the flight had to try and find forms at Delhi airport which was hard as they seemed to have run out. A helpful passenger had an extra form and I was saved.

A380 Dubai - Melbourne. Seated in exit row 52 although some kind of fridge malfunction had soaked the floor so we had to use blankets in order not to get wet - it being a full flight and already in exit row wasn't really going to give it up. Food was slightly disappointing - still perfectly edible but nothing special. IFE was great for TV loads of series but fewer movies. Inflight WIFI is a nice touch although it took me 10 hours to log on. I sent them a complaint email about the wet floor during the flight which I think is pretty good. Overall - the Qantas-Emirates tie up is great for Europe to Australia especially with the overnight timings of the flights and A380's going all directions.

I flew twice with Emirates in December - Bangkok-Dubai-Gatwick returning Heathrow-Dubai-Bangkok then again Bangkok-Dubai-Istanbul and return. Their inflight entertainment options are above average although their headsets were broken 50% of the time. Other than this I am sad to say on both flights I was disappointed with all aspects of their service. Our group were always split in the most odd fashion - even on our business class flight I was separated several rows apart which made no sense. Food options ran out on one flight - chicken or lamb my parents cannot eat lamb but they ran out of chicken - no alternative or other option! We were no where near the back row so obviously many other passengers only had lamb as an option! There are far better options out there for similar prices or cheaper.

My journey from Bangkok to London Gatwick return was the best journey I have had. On all sectors LGW-DXB-BKK and BKK-DXB-LGW I had a pleasant flight. Flight crew were extremely helpful smiling all the time food and drinks were served on time and food was surprisingly tasty. Fleet that served us on different legs of the journey were as following LGW-DXB was on B777-300ER DXB-BKK was on A380-800 BKK –DXB was on A380-800 DXB-LGW was on B777-300ER. Seating arrangements on both Emirates B777-300ER and A380-800 is 3-4-3 I have always considered these seating arrangements to be very cramped. Surprisingly Emirates somehow made it feel specious with plenty of leg room. Entertainment on board both B777-300ER and A380-800 was wonderful with over 1000 channels of entertainment to choose from flying cannot get boring. If you do manage to get bored then many of the Emirates B777 and A380 are fitted with inflight WIFI internet OnAir at a very reasonable price. I paid £0.63 for 600mb that's enough to last me on all my sectors. Overall I enjoyed everything Emirates had to offer staff were very helpful on board and on ground. Services offered on board were more than I expected. Entertainment food and drinks on board were by the best I have had so far on an aeroplane.

Flew HAM-DXB-BLR and returned BLR-DXB-HAM in mid-December 2014 with Emirates. Before taking this flight I'd heard the hype about Emirates being one of the best airlines so was looking forward to the trip. How far could the reality be from the hype? A long way. Where to begin? The seats are not comfortable stewardesses missed me twice when bringing drinks around and once when bringing meals (I wasn't asleep they just didn't ask and were looking away from me so I couldn't get their attention until I had to practically shout at them - which got an angry- looking glare). On the return leg from BLR to DXB I got a nosebleed in flight and wanted to ask them for tissues - I used the call button but nobody came. Waited several minutes then tried again this went on until the bleeping stopped after about 15 minutes. Not one attendant came to repeated buzzing over that time. Finally it stopped and I got out of my window seat and to the toilet to take care of it myself. I noticed during the flights to BLR and on the return that there were plenty of other people who also got no responses to their calls - they finally gave up or I saw a couple of them get up from their seats and find an attendant themselves - so ignoring passengers seems to be corporate policy.

Just flew PER-DXB-FRA. We found the overall experience to be disappointing and don't understand all the hype about Emirates being one of the best. The seats were narrow and hard which made them very uncomfortable for long flights. Qantas has way better seats. The food was average nothing to note at all. The biggest disappointment was with the unfriendly soulless cabin crew on both flights. Barely a smile out of any of them. They looked like they were dead walking just going through the motions of their jobs. One in fact entertained us by digging around for ear wax a few times and then flicking into the aisle. She was gross! Not at all what we were expecting.

KUL-MEL-KUL. The outbound flight to MEL was perfect and in-flight service was top notch. However the inbound flight to KUL was less than ideal. There was at least a 75 minute delay out of MEL. I think this is to do with day-light saving time (1hr) in MEL plus a bit more. I think it is the airlines responsibility to adjust and advertise the correct departure times in cases such as this. I was not informed when I checked in over the web or the counter staff at the baggage drop.

My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on DEL-DXB-NCE-CDG-DXB-DEL between 8th and 16th December and were disappointed with the service that the airline offered. The DEL-DXB and DXB-DEL flights were the most horrible that I have encountered so far. The staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. On our DEL-DXB flight I requested for water thrice but it never came and on my third request I was rudely told by the staff that she can't give me water as she had other priorities to take care of. It was a clear sign that Emirates is not interested in taking care of its flyers. Our flight from CDG-DXB was also not great as the supply of water and juices was intermittent. However I have high regards for the crew flying on DXB-NCE flight on the morning of 8th December. They were courteous helpful and very prompt in their service. They made our journey special with a small pastry when they got to know that we were newlyweds. But this was plain luck as the rest three legs of the journey were very disappointing and we have decided not to fly Emirates again. The attitude of the staff clearly showed that passengers should not expect after sales service once they have paid for their tickets.,6,2014-12-22,India,False,husband travelled emirate del dxb nce cdg dxb del th th december disappointed service airline offered del dxb dxb del flight horrible encountered far staff extremely rude unhelpful del dxb flight requested water thrice never came third request rudely told staff give water priority take care clear sign emirate interested taking care flyer flight cdg dxb also great supply water juice intermittent however high regard crew flying dxb nce flight morning th december courteous helpful prompt service made journey special small pastry got know newlywed plain luck rest three leg journey disappointing decided fly emirate attitude staff clearly showed passenger expect sale service paid ticket
I flew Business Class Dubai to Casablanca return (777-300) and Dubai to Addis Ababa return (A330-200) last month. All flights were on time cabin crew and service excellent meals pretty good. I really couldn't fault them. The angled lay flat seat on the 777-300 is comfy and I never fully recline it to flat - I find it much more comfortable to put it into a kind of almost lying down lazy boy chair so both ends raised slightly off flat. While I've read many poor reviews on the Business class seats in the A330-200 I have to say I found it very comfy. It definitely doesn't stack up against their long haul A380 seats or even the 777-300 but I was very comfortable with the deep recline great footrests ( so much room) and comfy leather seats. These aircraft's are usually only used on their shorter flights and in this situation I have no problems.,8,2014-12-22,Australia,False,flew business class dubai casablanca return dubai addis ababa return last month flight time cabin crew service excellent meal pretty good really fault angled lay flat seat comfy never fully recline flat find much comfortable put kind almost lying lazy boy chair end raised slightly flat read many poor review business class seat say found comfy definitely stack long haul seat even comfortable deep recline great footrest much room comfy leather seat aircraft usually used shorter flight situation problem

We flew from LGW to DXB (777-300) stopped in DXB for 3 days and flew onwards from DXB to BNE (A380) as we'd heard good reviews of Emirates and wanted to see a little of UAE. Emirates offered the best price and connections to/from Australia and New Zealand. Really disappointing LGW to DXB service - staff were rude had no personality and seemed rushed. Food was average and entertainment not much better. We left the flight in DXB more than willing to give them a second chance to impress on the longer DXB-BNE sector (14hrs on the A380) but more of the same. Staff were rude unfriendly seemed rushed to complete service more concerned with doing their make-up (we were sat next to the galley) than much else. Really poor. We're flying back CHC-SYD-BKK-DXB-LGW and to say that we're looking forward to it would be misleading.

"Not sure why Qantas decided to partner with Emirates - terrible deal for Qantas customers! Travelling from Dubai to New York on the A380 I bought paid for the WiFi access and used it for about 5 minutes before it went off. When I complained to the onboard service director she told me that Emirates was not responsible for the service and that I needed to write to ""inner"" the service provider. This was absolutely shocking - in my opinion Emirates is responsible for every service offered on it's flights. Also flying from LHR to Dubai on a night flight my seat was damaged and wouldn't recline so having paid for a first class seat I was unable to get a nights rest (the aircrew told me that they knew the seat was damaged before the flight left but that the engineer was unable to fix it). The flight was full so I was unable to be relocated but I would have preferred to have been given the choice of another flight - this is what Qantas would have done.

Boston - Dubai - Mumbai. The long haul 777's economy section is scandalous. It's the equivalent of flying on a cramped domestic airplane for 14 hours. Honestly I have flown many international trips in Economy and never have I been this uncomfortable. In a standard seat it is so narrow that I had to take turns eating with the passenger next to me because neither of us had enough arm room to cut food. There was absolutely no back support in the 'new and improved' economy seats and the 3-4-3 seating is too much for the 777 – so much so that the flight attendants do not even apologize when they hit your seat every time they walk by you in the narrow aisles. On the way from Dubai back to Boston my entertainment touchscreen misregistered every tap meaning that any time I went to pause a movie the system either exited rewound to the beginning or switched to a view of the map. It is clear that Emirates the is flying on a reputation clearly earned before its new-found desire for profit over passenger well being. Like American domestics they will now punish the passenger for the benefit of their bottom line. Unfortunately I will not fly Emirates again if they continue their push for more and more seats in Economy.,4,2014-12-04,United States,False,boston dubai mumbai long haul economy section scandalous equivalent flying cramped domestic airplane hour honestly flown many international trip economy never uncomfortable standard seat narrow take turn eating passenger next neither u enough arm room cut food absolutely back support new improved economy seat seating much much flight attendant even apologize hit seat every time walk narrow aisle way dubai back boston entertainment touchscreen misregistered every tap meaning time went pause movie system either exited rewound beginning switched view map clear emirate flying reputation clearly earned new found desire profit passenger well like american domestic punish passenger benefit bottom line unfortunately fly emirate continue push seat economy

Boarding was quick and water was served since there was no air-conditioning on the ground due to the technical. On board we got the menu card and soon drinks and snacks where served before getting lunch. Meal choices was matched and even our no lactose meals was no problem. Flight was smooth and crew came around with water and juice. In between they served ice cream that was nice. ICE avod was nice with plenty of choices. Arriving in Dubai we got a remote stand so we where bussed to terminal that was quick because they use a lot of busses and there was no waiting at all. Would fly them again seats are nice with good legroom compared to LH UA AA or BA and AF/KL.,1,2014-11-20,Germany,False,st october flew dusseldorf dubai ek boeing er check seat booked via travel agent honored check economy queue still fast easy boarding half hour later due technical took almost hour take problem far boarding quick water served since air conditioning ground due technical board got menu card soon drink snack served getting lunch meal choice matched even lactose meal problem flight smooth crew came around water juice served ice cream nice ice avod nice plenty choice arriving dubai got remote stand bussed terminal quick use lot bus waiting would fly seat nice good legroom compared lh ua aa ba af kl
Flew from Brussels-Dubai-Tokyo and back again a total of 34 hours on Emirates planes. Absolutely outstanding airline. The crew were immaculately turned out and very friendly. The plane was clean and the meals were delicious. The inflight entertainment was also very good with a wide choice of games/films though some of the older planes have a slightly less user friendly interface. One feature I liked was as your plane nears Dubai on the inflight entertainment screen you can see where your connecting flight gate/terminal is. Families with young kids also get complimentary strollers when they land.,8,2014-11-20,Belgium,False,flew brussels dubai tokyo back total hour emirate plane absolutely outstanding airline crew immaculately turned friendly plane clean meal delicious inflight entertainment also good wide choice game film though older plane slightly le user friendly interface one feature liked plane nears dubai inflight entertainment screen see connecting flight gate terminal family young kid also get complimentary stroller land
I have just completed a trip LGW to HKG on Emirates via DXB in Business Class. The London to Dubai and Dubai to London were on a 777-300ER the DXB to HKG on an A380. What a difference. The A380 was comfort personified. You are cocooned in your little area with nobody beside or immediately in front of you - I was in seat 23K. You have plenty of space with easy access out to the aisle. The 777 however felt very cramped with somebody sitting next to you. When that passenger has his seat in bed mode you have to clamber over his legs to get out to the aisle. With the A380 you have plenty of storage space with the deep side compartments. On the 777 there is no place to store anything other than the overhead locker. Up until experiencing the A380/777 difference I have never much cared about the airplane I am sitting on - from now on for me it just has to be the A380. Had I taken all legs of this trip on the A380 the marks given would be much higher in the Trip Satisfaction and Seat Comfort.,1,2014-11-20,United Kingdom,False,completed trip lgw hkg emirate via dxb business class london dubai dubai london er dxb hkg difference comfort personified cocooned little area nobody beside immediately front seat k plenty space easy access aisle however felt cramped somebody sitting next passenger seat bed mode clamber leg get aisle plenty storage space deep side compartment place store anything overhead locker experiencing difference never much cared airplane sitting taken leg trip mark given would much higher trip satisfaction seat comfort
1st November Dubai to Cape Town on EK 772 on a Boeing 777-300. Transfer in Dubai at night is always full but not as bad as on any other airport. Boarding was on time but had to wait for take off clearance as the pilot informed us. Flight was with snack at the beginning and a nice breakfast before landing with one meal being lactose free. Crew was nice and helpful. We got a nice sleep on the 9 hour flight. ICE Avod system was the new one with even more choices and movies. In CPT luggage was on the belt when we arrived there.

LHR - DXB - CPT. Quick boarding of A380 direct from T3 Emirates lounge. Centre pair of seats excellent for a couple. FAs rather robotic with little warmth or humour. Dinner service slow with overcooked main course. A380 impressively quiet on upper deck. Excellent IFE but annoying that one has to use supplied noise cancelling headphones. Flat bed seats reasonably comfortable. Quick disembarkation to huge Emirates lounge at DXB. Bizarre bus journey (30 minutes!) to 770-300 on the other side of the airport for the flight to CPT.

MEL-AKL-MEL in J Class. Wonderful service on both sectors with a really varied and friendly crew on each sector. Staff were oblivious to the call button on the return leg the bight little light above my seat didn't attract anyone's attention which I found quite grating considering how professional these crew were appearing to be. The seats were extremely comfortable and although perhaps not quite as comfortable as some airlines lie flat fold over beds for sectors like this they were great. The scrambled eggs on the breakfast flight out of MEL were very disappointing and quite solid but a small grizzle. The dinner on the AKL-MEL leg was exceptional the best steak I've had in the sky! The bar at the back is a great feature it was packed coming back into MEL. For this reason I'd avoid sitting in the rear cabin the noise would be too much on a long night flight. Only real (yet again very minor in the scheme of things) complaint when our jackets were handed back as we started to descend there was nowhere to hang them around the seat. They had to lie crumpled on our lap or draped along the bins at the side. A hook in the seat back would be so handy. Would recommend anytime and aside from the couple of small complaints a perfect way to fly. Well done EK.

Traveled Business Class to LHR - EK005 on the 5th November returning from MAN - EK022 on the 11th November 2014. The 380 flight to London had a delayed departure but this did not deter me from enjoying the flight in total. The return flight from Manchester on a 777-ER was serviced by a crew that was second to none. On both legs the quality of food served was excellent in fact I go as far to say it gets better and better every time I fly with Emirates. I am a gold Card member preferring to travel with Emirates on all my flights. Enjoying the journey with Emirates really starts in the Business lounges.

LGW to HKG return. I was pleasantly surprised with this airline. The staff were actually interested in the passengers and polite and hard working. There was no amenity kit but we did get hot towels. The food was tasty and plenty of it. Sensibly they only served a light snack on the very early departure from Dubai. We were late leaving London but made up the time and caught our connection. Plenty of films to watch.

Recently flew AMS-DBX-BKK the first time that I deviated from my favourite SQ. Flight left AMS 75m late and approaching DBX was put in a holding pattern for over an hour. That - and the fact that the A380 was parked about 25m by bus away the terminal - left me very little time to catch my connecting flight even though I was in the second bus. Surprisingly on reaching the terminal there was no ground staff around - there must have been many people missing connections - and after security I had to walk a long distance and eventually did not make it in time. After queuing for over an hour in front of an understaffed Emirates transit desk I finally got booked onto a later flight and spent the following 5h in the Emirates Business lounge. That following flight - a 777 - left an hour late too. Was lucky that my Emirates chauffeur-drive was still available in BKK. The flights were otherwise uneventful. Seating on both planes was good but definitely less roomy than on SQ's 777. Food was OK service on board friendly. My return flight is coming up and hopefully that will be a better experience transit- wise. Will withhold my recommendation of Emirates to others till after that event. Again I was very much surprised that nobody was meeting the transit passengers arriving over 2h late. In similar situations at Changi/Singapore SQ staff is there to either get you to your plane in time or if it too late altogether make immediate arrangements to get you to your destination as soon as possible.,5,2014-11-06,Netherlands,False,recently flew am dbx bkk first time deviated favourite sq flight left am late approaching dbx put holding pattern hour fact parked bus away terminal left little time catch connecting flight even though second bus surprisingly reaching terminal ground staff around must many people missing connection security walk long distance eventually make time queuing hour front understaffed emirate transit desk finally got booked onto later flight spent following h emirate business lounge following flight left hour late lucky emirate chauffeur drive still available bkk flight otherwise uneventful seating plane good definitely le roomy sq food ok service board friendly return flight coming hopefully better experience transit wise withhold recommendation emirate others till event much surprised nobody meeting transit passenger arriving h late similar situation changi singapore sq staff either get plane time late altogether make immediate arrangement get destination soon possible

My first leg was with a fabulous crew of young female flight attendants. I was travelling with my husband and my 9 year old daughter. My daughter was treated like an absolute princess. My daughter was given flight packs and a child's meal (which I didn't request). The service was excellent and served with a smile and professional manner. The food was lovely better than expected. The food was some of the loveliest presented airline food I have had. The cabin toilets were always kept clean and dry. The inflight entertainment ICE is second to none.

Very good airline but unfortunately the boarding/disembarking procedures at Dubai airport are a nightmare. Except for flights operated with A380 which are parked at gates for many flights operated with B777 and A330 the airplanes are parked at remote stands which means long (20 to 40 minutes) transfers by bus between planes and the terminal building.

Leaving on QF 1 on 12 Oct and from Dubai back to Sydney via London on Emirates planes. All sectors on A380. The aircraft is the common factor between Qantas and Emirates. But the experience is so different. The Qantas flight attendants are very professional in the way they go about their work. Emirates FA's are to a man and woman under 30 lack experience and customer skills. On EK 2 from LHR to Dubai on Saturday 18 October it was particularly bad. A couple of FA's would not have been out of place on easyJet. One fixed up her lipstick during a meal service whilst serving. On four sectors flown in the last week on Qantas and Emirates planes it can be said that Qantas came out way on top. This is not some pro Australian rant. Have been using Qantas and Emirates combination for a while now and the same result. What can Emirates do? Get some serious training for their cabin crews and some old heads on board to oversee the younger staff. At the moment they all look and act like kids serving in McDonald's.

First and probably last time with Emirates. At least not on this connection to Beijing. EK306 arrives into Beijing at 15:10h. It is a 500 Passenger flight arriving simultaneously with other flights from Singapore Hong-Kong Dubai Doha Fukuoka and Vancouver. Immigration took nearly 2 hours due to the masses of people arriving. Chauffeur Service did not wait. Disgraceful Emirates Service at the Airport and no apologies whatsoever. The immigration staff did their very best to speed up the process and all 24 Counters were open. Just way way to many people arriving at the same time. 15.10.2014 EK60 HAM-DXB on B777 and continuing on EK306 DXB-PEK A380. Chauffeur service to HAM excellent new Mercedes S-Class all the comfort you need before a 16h Trip to Beijing. Lounge at HAM okay - lots of good quality food and drink quiet and very large thus not crowded even though flight was fully booked in Business Class. Aircraft was very new (April 2014) but 5 Row Business Class is just unacceptable. No real storage. Agree with most users that Seat is much too narrow and doesn't go fully flat (opposed to A380) I am a smaller person and the seat would not really fit in any position. Food was okay. Good but grumpy stewardess serving my seat. Overall a typical flight on a fully packed plane. DXB is a very nice airport (even at night) but very crowded. Business Lounge in T3A is good but very slow and spotty WiFi. Boarding directly to A380 Upper Deck is a nice touch but also clearly a necessity because of the crowds and cramped waiting areas for Y guests on the main floor.

Compared to anything we have in the U.S. and other international airlines I've flown this organization is top- notch. Or at least they try to be.

"CMB-DXB: EK655: A330-200 Oct 12: Business Class. Plane immaculate for its age (1999-2000). However horribly let down by the most uncomfortable Business Class seats I've ever experienced over the past 17 years. Seven across in Business Class instead of six in an A330 is a rip-off. These seats are nothing like the nice new modular units in their B777-300ER aircraft. The video remote control intrudes into the 18"" wide seats making them clamp-like seats. Not suitable for the 4.5 hour flight. Service was very good and the food and beverages were good too. There were only five passengers that day in Business Class on this flight and I had the single row area behind First Class to myself. The tray table is too low when the seat is even slightly reclined. These are old cradle seats not flatbeds. The whole experience was let down by these awful seats the main reason one buys Business Class in the first place to get more personal space not something worse-than Economy Plus. Check-in and the dedicated Emirates Lounge at the BIA in CMB were excellent. On time performance and good baggage transfer to my connecting BA flight.

I usually fly to Europe in economy class with Singapore Airlines via Singapore or Thai Airways via Bangkok but was persuaded to try Emirates. I found the 14.5 hours from Sydney to Dubai to be unbearable. The service from flight staff was both difficult to access and disinterested. Staff on the second leg to Amsterdam were much more personable. The experience was so bad that I have paid almost $3800 to upgrade to Business Class for the return journey.

Flown MNL-DXB-MNL Sept 20 on EK 337. I was amazed by the in-flight service. Five drink runs on an 8 hour flight food is plenty and palatable. All the crew are hard-working attentive and friendly.

LAX to Hyderabad Economy October 102014 I always use Singapore Airlines and I decided to try Emirates for a change. Long story short: Singapore Airlines wins. Pros - the seating is comfortable great selection on entertainment nice mood lighting nice warm facial towels are provided to freshen up quick water service when requested. Cons - Food I ordered a Asian vegetarian meal 2 weeks in advance. It is actually offered as a part of the regular choice of 3 main course meals but it ran out before it got to my seat. This happened on the Dubai to Hyderabad flight which was for 3.5 hours. On the other flight I lucked out getting the last vegetarian meal. The main food meal service (lunch or dinner) is pretty filling. I felt Emirates should have reserved Asian vegetarian meals for those who pre-order and offer extra ones for the rest of the passengers during the service. A vegetarian pizza was given as a light snack in between - very salty. Dubai airport is poor when I compare it to Changi in Singapore. I was given a meal voucher at the ticketing desk. If you have a layover for over 4 hours you can get a free meal at Dubai airport. Also the free internet stations are horrible. The internet is slow and the machines cannot seem to load Internet explorer. I gave up after 5 mins of trying. Not worth using the Wifi there either. Dubai airport ever heard of high speed internet? Be prepared for the most unfriendly airport staff you will ever come across. No smile angry replies.

Arrived at Dubai DBX at 18.15 for 21.45 on 10/10/14 flight to Perth to be told flight was over booked we had been travelling through Europe for eight weeks and had a stop over in Dubai. I was very surprised to hear we had no seats having booked the flight nearly 12 months in advance. We only managed to secure seats after we explained our daughter was flying overseas on the 11/10/14 and we would not see her for 3 months. We have travelled with Emirates several times because of the quick connecting flights to Europe but intend to look at other airlines operating from that area in future. We were very disappointed they way we were treated by Emirates on the last leg of our journey home it was the only blemish of our holiday.,6,2014-10-22,Australia,False,arrived dubai dbx flight perth told flight booked travelling europe eight week stop dubai surprised hear seat booked flight nearly month advance managed secure seat explained daughter flying overseas would see month travelled emirate several time quick connecting flight europe intend look airline operating area future disappointed way treated emirate last leg journey home blemish holiday

Dinner was served after midnight although the flight took off at 8.15pm by then I was desperate for water which the crew kept saying they would serve with dinner. They ran out of choices on their menu and could only serve chicken. We were not served any breakfast nor a beverage before landing.

After not having flown on Emirates in almost 7 years I recently flew EK round trip NYC/JFK to Milan/MXP. Departed on Thu 2nd Oct and returned Wed 8th Oct. Friendly service on both flights. Smiling and smartly turned out flight attendants on both flights always seen in the cabins. On the outbound flight - flying time of 7 hours 5 minutes 2 hot meals served. In between the meals 2 beverage services were provided. I like many other passengers skipped the hot breakfast in favor of more sleep time. On my return flight with flying time of 8 hours and 40 minutes a copious hot lunch was followed by an offering of fresh fruits and snack bars from wicker baskets. This was followed by a hot pizza snack and then about an hour prior to landing the same wicker baskets with fruits snack bars and pre-wrapped vegetarian sandwiches were offered.

DMM-DXB-LAX return trip on Sept 18 and Oct 6 2014. I am a frequent traveller on this route at least 3 times a year and always with Emirates. After so many years of loyalty I am now tempted to try other airlines for the following reasons: Menu does not change on this route and it gets so unexciting and predictable after so many flights. While quantity of food is generous the taste is so below average. I have never seen sea-food being offered on this menu it is always the predictable steak Indian dish and Arabic dish. On board service consistency is very patchy sometimes I am lucky to be served by kind and helpful flight attendant in 50% of the flights I had not. Simple things such as smile when attending the customer never miss any customer when laying down mattress on long haul flight will be appreciated. While other aspects such as on-time arrival IFE lounge access complimentary limousine pick up at LAX are fine the on-board menu needs to be improved to retain customer loyalty. Considering that Emirates are charging premium and much more expensive that competitors I see no reason why it cannot improve on the menu and consistency of on-board service. Loyal customers such as myself are now shopping around for better experience and value than what Emirates is offering at the moment on the route. With less generous miles and redeeming a ticket now will cost close to 1000 dollars in additional fees and charges there has been something Emirates truly learned from its partner Qantas in how to upset its loyal customers by slapping them with 4 digit charges. Come on Emirates you used to wow me but not anymore.,8,2014-10-20,Saudi Arabia,False,dmm dxb lax return trip sept oct frequent traveller route least time year always emirate many year loyalty tempted try airline following reason menu change route get unexciting predictable many flight quantity food generous taste average never seen sea food offered menu always predictable steak indian dish arabic dish board service consistency patchy sometimes lucky served kind helpful flight attendant flight simple thing smile attending customer never miss customer laying mattress long haul flight appreciated aspect time arrival ife lounge access complimentary limousine pick lax fine board menu need improved retain customer loyalty considering emirate charging premium much expensive competitor see reason cannot improve menu consistency board service loyal customer shopping around better experience value emirate offering moment route le generous mile redeeming ticket cost close dollar additional fee charge something emirate truly learned partner qantas upset loyal customer slapping digit charge come emirate used wow anymore
EK147 Y 22 Sep Dubai to Amsterdam. First time with Emirates on their A380 crew friendly on boarding. Seating was comfortable with excellent inflight entertainment system. Was served a light breakfast after departure which was tasty. We were situated reasonably close to the galley on this flight and I can't but help feel this particular crew may have been in training under the eyes of a supervisor with exacting standards. The inflight service food and beverage service was great not too much but not too little. Inflight announcements were clear. Lunch menu had a good choice and again was very tasty as was the free flowing wine service which I personally enjoyed.,7,2014-10-20,New Zealand,False,ek sep dubai amsterdam first time emirate crew friendly boarding seating comfortable excellent inflight entertainment system served light breakfast departure tasty situated reasonably close galley flight help feel particular crew may training eye supervisor exacting standard inflight service food beverage service great much little inflight announcement clear lunch menu good choice tasty free flowing wine service personally enjoyed

ICN-DXB and DXB-LIS between October 5/6 on economy. Check-in was smooth and simple at ICN. Departed about 10 minutes late but arrived about 20 minutes early. Staff ranged from nice to snippy. Food was good with multiple drinks services in between meals. Noodles were available between meals but didn't see anyone having them. Entertainment system on A380 was state-of-the-art and worked perfectly with countless movies TV shows and albums to pick from. Wi-fi was free on that flight thanks to Eid and worked flawlessly on phone and tablet. Seats comfortable and roomy. Arrival and transfer in DXB was normal. DXB-LIS had an older B777 which is not as good but my window seat was on the back which has a 2-4-2 configuration. Recommend getting a seat on that section as you have more aisle space. Food was better than on the other flight with multiple drinks services in between meals again. Entertainment system is the same but the touch screen wasn't as responsive and software was slightly slower due to age of plane. Staff was nicer and didn't mind engaging in chit-chat with passengers.

Just flew return BNE to DXB on A380 and then onto VCE on a B777. I agree with what many on here have said. If your flight is on an A380 then it will be excellent plenty of space plenty of food and drinks toilets clean and spacious. If you are on on B777 not so good - cramped seat configuration staff overworked felt not much different to a budget carrier. If it were a long haul flight I would consider another airline.,1,2014-10-12,Australia,False,flew return bne dxb onto vce b agree many said flight excellent plenty space plenty food drink toilet clean spacious b good cramped seat configuration staff overworked felt much different budget carrier long haul flight would consider another airline
"Flew on the EK 38 on September from Birmingham to Dubai. First time flight on Emirates very disappointed! Expected great things long wait for bar service told not long after two hours food arrived no drinks. Asked cabin crew ""it's a short flight"" we are not serving drinks until later.

My flight was a true class act. Flew First Class DFW-DXB and it was better than expected. The crew were friendly and personable aiming to please throughout the flight. From the Dom Perignon champagne to onboard shower onboard lounge at the back of business class to the limo ride to my hotel in Dubai it was a flight to remember. This was my first time flying Emirates and after reading some of the mixed reviews here I have to say my experience surpassed all my expectations. For the benefit of readers I have flown a lot being a Lufthansa Hon (highest tier status) for the past 6 years. My opinion is the European carriers have a lot of catching up to do if they are to retain their share of premium passengers especially from the USA where Emirates is rapidly expanding.,8,2014-10-12,United States,False,flight true class act flew first class dfw dxb better expected crew friendly personable aiming please throughout flight dom perignon champagne onboard shower onboard lounge back business class limo ride hotel dubai flight remember first time flying emirate reading mixed review say experience surpassed expectation benefit reader flown lot lufthansa hon highest tier status past year opinion european carrier lot catching retain share premium passenger especially usa emirate rapidly expanding
We were really looking forward to our A380 Melbourne to Auckland and return trip on a top airline. Although the plane was clean and comfortable. There were problems with staff and service. Our flight over was a 7am departure yet after the initial delivery of hot towels staff were absent unless called for nearly 2 hours not even to offer of water! Breakfast when it finally arrived was tasty although beverages came much later than the food. The same thing happened on the flight back a 6.30 pm departure with no food or drink until 8.15. On a nearly 4 hour flight drinks should be much more freely available.
